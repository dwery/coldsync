=head1 NAME

copy-appinfo - ColdSync conduit to copy the AppInfo block (categories)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Add the following to your F<.coldsyncrc> file:

	conduit sync {
		type: addr/DATA;
		type: memo/DATA;
		type: todo/DATA;
		...
		path: <...>/copy-appinfo;
	}

	conduit sync {
		type: addr/DATA;
		type: memo/DATA;
		type: todo/DATA;
		...
		path: [generic];
	}

(the "[generic]" block is so that the databases in question will be synced
the normal way, in addition to having their AppInfo blocks copied.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<copy-appinfo> conduit copies the AppInfo block (which contains
information about categories and certain other application-specific data)
from the Palm to the desktop.

Since ColdSync's generic conduit does not touch the AppInfo block at all,
you need to use C<copy-appinfo> or something like it to keep category data
in sync.

Note that this conduit only implements Palm-overwrites-desktop. If you
modify any categories in the desktop copy of a database, those changes will
be lost.

=head1 BUGS

None known.
