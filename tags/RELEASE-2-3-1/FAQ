Q: My Palm got reset, and when I synched with ColdSync, all my stuff got
   deleted! Help!
A: First of all, don't panic. This is the so-called Bargle Bug.
	1) Make a backup of your .palm directory:
		cp -rp .palm .palm.backup
   This isn't required, but is prudent in case you mess up your .palm
   directory.
	2) Make a restore directory, say
		mkdir /tmp/restore
	3) Copy your applications (.prc files) to the restore directory.
   They should be in ~/.palm/backup/Attic .
	4) All of the contents of your record databases (.pdb files) should
   be in the archive files in ~/.palm/archive . These files are in archive
   format, not .pdb format. Convert them to .pdb format using the
   `archive2pdb' tool, available at
	http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/archive2pdb
   Note that `archive2pdb' is very rough and unfinished, which is why it
   isn't part of the standard distribution. It will copy all of the records
   in the archive file to the .pdb file, including all of the stuff that
   you deleted months ago, which means that you'll have to delete it all
   over again.
	5) Restore your .pdb and .prc files to the Palm:
		coldsync -r /tmp/restore
	6) Clean up. Delete (on the Palm) all of the old stuff that you
   didn't mean to re-upload. All of your application categories will have
   been lost as well, so you'll need to recreate them again.

Q: ColdSync seems to start okay, but then fails with "ACK timeout".
A: Most likely, your Palm is running PalmOS 3.5 or later, and has a
   password set. Try unsetting the password.
	Early versions of PalmOS trusted the desktop implicitly. As of
   version 3.5, however, this is no longer the case: it expects the desktop
   to know the password on the Palm. I haven't sussed out yet how the
   desktop is supposed to tell this to the Palm, so ColdSync fails with
   password-protected Palms.

Q: Are these *really* frequently-asked questions?
A: No. ColdSync really doesn't have enough of a following for any questions
   to have been asked often enough to become tedious. But if I had called
   this the "AQ", people wouldn't find it.

Q: Have all of these questions really been asked?
A: No. Some of the questions in this list have been added to prevent their
   being asked. But if I had called this the "Q", people wouldn't find it.

Q: Is ColdSync better than pilot-link?
A: Well, *I* think so, otherwise I wouldn't have written it.
	Seriously: technically, pilot-link is mainly a library of
   functions for talking to Palm devices. ColdSync includes such a library
   as well. I think that the ColdSync library is better-written, in the
   sense of being more readable (and hence more easily maintained), better
   documented, and more robust.
	The ColdSync library is not compatible with pilot-link, nor was it
   ever intended to be. At the same time, they are designed for similar
   purposes, and so share some similarities. It should be possible to port
   an application like KPilot to the ColdSync library without superhuman
   effort.

	ColdSync the application... that's a matter of taste. Most of the
   syncing applications out there seem to be clones of existing
   Windows-based applications; they require you to be logged in, and to
   have X running.
	That wasn't what I wanted. I wanted something more Unix-y. When it
   grows up, ColdSync will be a daemon started at boot time that you'll
   never need to interact with directly.
	If that's not what you're looking for, well, there are plenty of
   other applications out there. Take your pick or write your own.

Q: Does ColdSync do X?
A: Depends on the value of X.

Q: Why doesn't ColdSync do X?
A: Depending on the value of X, there are three possible answers:
	1) I haven't had time to add it yet, and nobody's volunteered.
	2) I've considered it and rejected it.
	3) I haven't thought of it.

Q: I've set "speed 9600;" and now all I get is timeouts.
A: This is a known, if not understood problem.
	The immediate problem is that the Palm isn't transmitting at the
   speed that ColdSync expects. Why this is so I don't know, since ColdSync
   is supposed to dictate connection speed to the Palm.
	Under PalmOS 3.3, you can set the connection speed under
   HotSync -> Connection Setup -> Direct Serial -> Edit -> Details -> Speed
	Under earlier versions, you can play with
   HotSync -> Modem Setup -> Speed

Q: Why the Artistic license? Why not the GPL?
A: Philosophical answer: because I want ColdSync to be
   freely-distributable, without the limitations that the GPL imposes. I
   believe that all software, free or otherwise, should stand or fall on
   its own merits, and not because it matches someone's agenda.
	Real answer: because I don't really care that much. What I'd really
   like to say is "Do what you like with this. Just give credit where
   credit is due." ColdSync is not commercial because, quite frankly, I
   have neither the time nor the inclination to run a business.
	I also wanted to use a "canned" license, one that many eyeballs
   have debugged. The Artistic license was closest to what I was looking
   for.

Q: I added a new ToDo/Memo/whatever category on the Palm, and it hasn't
   shown up on the desktop.
A: Yup. This is an unsolved problem.
	Categories are stored in a database's AppInfo block. The AppInfo
   block can't be synced the same way as the data records. The Palm doesn't
   report when the AppInfo block has changed, the way it does for data
   records. There doesn't seem to be a good way to synchronize the AppInfo
   block without risking losing information.

Q: Why doesn't ColdSync synchronize my preferences?
A: Preferences, such as your e-mail signature, your preferred time and date
   format, and so on, are kept in .prc files. .prc files do not lend
   themselves to syncing, for many of the same reasons as the AppInfo
   block: they don't have flags indicating whether they've changed since
   the last sync, and you can't have more than one copy of each one.

Q: Does ColdSync work with the Handspring Visor?
A: Yes.
   Under FreeBSD 4.x, use

	listen usb {
		device: /dev/ugen0;
	}

   in your .coldsyncrc . If you want to run ColdSync from usbd, use the
   following /etc/usbd.conf entry:

	device "Handspring Visor"
	vendor 0x082d
	product 0x0100
	release 0x0100
	attach "/usr/local/bin/coldsync -s -md -t usb ${DEVNAME}"

	Linux users can follow the instructions at
   http://usbvisor.sourceforge.net/Handspring-Visor-mini-HOWTO
   Then sync with /dev/ttyUSB1. In the .coldsyncrc, use "listen serial",
   since ColdSync won't be accessing the USB port directly.

   Gaspar Chilingarov <nm@web.am> for this information.)

Q: Does ColdSync work with the Sony Clie?
A: Yes. See http://kreucher.user.msu.edu/clie/

Q: Does ColdSync work with the Palm M50x series?
A: Yes, though USB support is still very incomplete. Under Linux, you can
   sync over USB; under other OSes, you'll need to use a serial cradle.
	Syncing over USB involves a somewhat different set of protocols
   from serial syncing. Palm has not published documentation on either set
   of protocols, so this may never work properly.

Q: Does ColdSync support syncing via the infrared port?
A: Not directly, but yes.
	You need to install an IrCOMM handler, which will make your IR port
   behave like an RS-232 serial port. As far as I know, the only OS with a
   working IrCOMM implementation is Linux.
	Several people have reported being able to sync over IR, though I
   have so far been unable to duplicate their success. You should probably
   start with the IR-HOWTO that comes with the Redhat distribution.

Q: ColdSync doesn't detect my Visor's serial number correctly.
A: As far as I've been able to determine, the Handspring Visor does not
   allow one to get at the serial number in software.
	The Visor appears to support reading ROM tokens, which is the way
   one reads the serial number in software. It even appears to have an
   "snum" ROM token. However, the contents of this token are not a
   12-character string, but a set of 12 0xff bytes.

Q: I initialized my Visor the way ColdSync said, and now it won't sync!
A: If it told you to set the serial number with
	pda {
		snum: "*Visor*-G";
	}
   take out the "-G". This is due to a bug.

Q: How can I find out the user name and user ID on my Palm, in order to set
   up my .coldsyncrc correctly?
A: Two ways: the simplest is to run
	coldsync -mI
   If the username and userid don't match what's in your .coldsyncrc, it
   will suggest a palm{} block to add to your .coldsyncrc.

	A more direct way, however, is to write
	<Shortcut> . 4
   on your Palm. The username and userid will be displayed on the screen.
