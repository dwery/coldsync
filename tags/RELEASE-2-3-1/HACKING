- Try to leave this code as clean as you wish you had found it.

- If you're in a rush to get something done, but something isn't quite
  right, put an XXX comment (with explanation) next to it. Otherwise,
  odds are you won't be able to easily find it and fix it next week;
  certainly no one else will.

- Nobody likes to write documentation, but it _is_ important. If you
  add a feature, at the very least add an item to the "TODO" file,
  e.g., "Documentation: describe the `foo' keyword in pda{} blocks."
	Better yet, write the documentation now, before you forget.

- Priorities: when you're deciding how to implement such-and-such
  feature, remember that the cardinal sin in syncing is loss of data:
  whatever you do, don't delete anything unless there's a backup
  somewhere, or you're certain that it isn't needed.
	The next issue is that things should be optimized for the
  user. In particular, try to minimize total sync time. If you have to
  choose between allocating a few Mb of memory for a cache, or making
  the user wait another second for a sync to complete, choose the
  former. Waiting is boring.

- As much as possible, if you add something, try to make it optional.
  E.g., KDE and Gnome support would be cool, but not everyone is
  running KDE or Gnome, so don't assume that they are available.

- As a corollary, don't force users to install your favorite tool,
  library, or whatever: don't assume that everyone uses GNU make, or
  Berkeley make, or bison and flex.

- Always compile with "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" (or the local equivalent
  of a language lawyer looking over your shoulder). If you stick to
  the rules, you're less likely to introduce some non-portability or a
  memory leak.

- If you modify an existing struct, see if it has a "constructor" or
  "destructor"-like function, and update them accordingly.. My
  convention is that if you have a 'struct foo', then the constructor
  will be named 'new_foo()', and the destructor will be named
  'free_foo()'.
	There might be other, "accessor" functions that manipulate the
  struct. Make sure to update them as well, if necessary.
	Hint: if you're changing the meaning of a field within a
  struct, change its name (temporarily). That way, you'll get a
  compilation error everywhere the old field is used. This forces you
  to make sure each use of the field is updated to the new meaning.

- Don't name any files "errs.*". They'll get clobbered by "make
  spotless".

- Remember: NUL (one ell) is the ASCII character \0. NULL (two ells)
  is the pointer that always looks like 0. NULL is a bigger zero than
  NUL.

- Portability: On some OSes, printf() checks to see whether the
  argument to a %s is NULL. On others, it doesn't. Always check.

- Portability: uid_t, off_t, and other types vary widely across
  systems. This can cause problems with printf(): under FreeBSD, off_t
  is a long long, which means that it needs to be printed with %Ld.
  Under Linux, on the other hand, off_t is a long, which means that it
  needs to be printed with %ld. Hence,
	printf("%Ld", my_off_t);
  will barf under Linux, but
	printf("%ld", my_off_t);
  will complain under FreeBSD.
	The best solution seems to be to cast the argument to the type
  of the format: some systems have 16-bit UIDs, others have 32-bit
  ones. But the following should work everywhere:
	printf("%ld", (long) my_uid_t);
  In the case of 'off_t', there is no good solution, since you can't
  portably print a 'long long' (as far as I know), and casting an
  'off_t' to 'long' will remove precision in the cases where it's a
  'long long'. In this particular package, however, I don't expect any
  files to be longer than a few Kb, to say nothing of 4Gb.

- I18N: when printing a message for the user's benefit, remember to
  enclose the string in _(), so that it can be translated, and show up
  in the user's native language.
	This does not apply to debugging messages; those are assumed
  to be temporary, and of interest mainly to the developer who wrote
  that chunk of code, so they can be in the developer's native
  language.
	Function names should not be translated. by and large,
  perror()'s argument need not be translated, since it's usually of
  the form "<system call>" or "<function name>: <system call>".

- I18N: when printing an error message of the form "<function-name>:
  <message>", print the function name as a separate argument, e.g.,
	fprintf(stderr, _("%s: I'm unhappy!\n"),
	        "my_function");
  instead of
	fprintf(stderr, _("my_function: I'm unhappy!\n"));

	Function names should not be translated into other languages,
  so this rule reduces the number of strings that a translator needs
  to deal with, especially with common error messages like "Out of
  memory".

- I18N: to make things easy on the translator, every string that you
  print should be at least one full sentence. Let's say that you want
  to print "Can't read the 12th record". In some languages, this might
  be better expressed as "Can't read record number 12" or "The 12th
  record cannot be read". So don't write
	fprintf(stderr, _("Can't read the "));
	fprintf(stderr, somestruct->n);
	fprintf(stderr, _("th record\n"));
  Rather, write
	fprintf(stderr, _("Can't read the %dth record\n"),
	        somestruct->n);

- When making changes to a file, respect the existing indentation
  style.

- "if", "while", "for", etc. are not functions. So don't make them
  look like functions. Use
	if (foo)
  and not
	if( foo )
