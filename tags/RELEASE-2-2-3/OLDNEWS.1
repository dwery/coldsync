Changes in 1.6.6:

	  created.

	- Bug fix: ColdSync aborts a network sync if it cannot

	  the network.

	- "-t net" runtime option selects listening on network.

	- Bug fix: If a file couldn't be uploaded to the Palm, this
	  didn't get logged properly.

	- Bug fix: The last database on the Palm never got synced or
	  backed up.

	- Feature: Setting the connection speed to 0 (or omitting it)
	  in .coldsyncrc makes ColdSync go with whatever speed the
	  Palm suggests.

	- Bug fix: ColdSync didn't properly detect whether it needed
	  to perform a slow or a fast sync.

Changes in 1.5.4:

	- Feature: If the Palm hasn't been properly initialized,

	- Feature: More robust in the face of noisy serial lines and

	- Feature: Added Init mode.

	- Bug fix: Usage string (for 'coldsync -h') is now up to date.

	  before reading user's .coldsyncrc .

	- Feature: Added Install conduits.

	- Bug fixes: miscellaneous bug fixes and stability
	  enhancements.

	  with cygwin.

	  dictionaries) used to be rejected as invalid.

Changes in 1.4.3:

	- Feature: The .coldsyncrc file can now specify a conduit with
	  path "[generic]" to run the built-in generic conduit. The
	  defaults haven't changed, but now you can specify other Sync
	  conduits, and the order in which they will run.

Changes in 1.4.2:

	- Added documentation for "preference:" feature.

Changes in 1.4.1:

	- Portability: Now stands a chance of compiling and running
	  properly under Windows.

Changes in 1.4.0:

	- Feature: Preferences. Conduits can now receive preferences
	  from the Palm.

Changes in 1.3.0:

	- Feature: Support for Sync conduits, which run while ColdSync
	  is connected to the Palm, and which allow interaction with
	  the Palm. (This is still very unfinished, though.)

	- The description of PDB format has been removed from the
	  distribution, since Palm now documents this quite adequately
	  and authoritatively:
	  http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/docs/fileformats.zip

Changes in 1.2.8:

	- No user-visible changes.

Changes in 1.2.7:

	- Feature: a conduit block may now contain several "type:"
	  lines.

Changes in 1.2.6:

	- No user-visible changes.

Changes in 1.2.5:

	- Bug fix: if stdin, stdout, or stderr were closed when
	  ColdSync was run, dump conduits misbehaved. Fixed.

Changes in 1.2.4:

	- Bug fix: if a record's category changes on the Palm, it
	  changes on the desktop as well.

	- Bug fix: generic conduit archived the wrong record
	  sometimes.

Changes in 1.2.3:

	- None that users care about.
	  (For the curious: conduit blocks now accept "preference:"
	  directives. But these aren't used anywhere yet.)

Changes in 1.2.2:

	- Feature: Conduit blocks now take a comma-separated list of
	  flavors.

Changes in 1.2.1:

	- Feature: You can now set the username and user ID on the
	  Palm.

Changes in 1.2.0:

	- Better support for i18n under Linux.

	- 'lex' is no longer supported. You need 'flex'.

	- Syntax: colons are now required after most directives in
	  .coldsyncrc . Currently, missing colons will cause a
	  warning. They will become mandatory in a future release.

	- Better reporting of errors in .coldsyncrc .

Changes in 1.1.10:

	- The distribution includes a sample .coldsyncrc .

	- Installation: You can now build ColdSync with one path
	  prefix and install it with another.

	- Bug fix: No longer causes the Palm to reset when syncing
	  certain databases.

	- Bug fix: If the type and creator were in double quotes, they
	  didn't get set correctly. Fixed.

Changes in 1.1.9:

	- Feature: if the "path" directive in a conduit block is
	  omitted, it is equivalent to a "do nothing" conduit. This
	  can be useful in conjunction with the "default" and "final"
	  options.
	- Future feature: PDAs can have a symbolic name.
	- Feature: conduits now take user-supplied configuration
	  arguments.
	- Feature: it is now possible to compile ColdSync with one
	  value of "prefix" and install it with another.
	- Added FAQ.
	- Several conduits added to the distribution.
	- Feature: ColdSync now tries to abort cleanly if the user
	  cancels the sync on the Palm.
	- Bug fix: All records in certain categories would
	  occasionally be seen as "deleted and archived".

Changes in 1.1.8:
	- Feature: ColdSync now reads the serial number from the
	  Palm's ROM, if possible. Users can specify "pda { }" blocks
	  in .coldsyncrc, and specify where the backup for a given PDA
	  should go.

Changes in 1.1.7:
	- Bug fix: log didn't get initialized properly.
	- Bug fix: deleting a record on the Palm could cause a
	  segmentation fault.
	- Now possible to force a new database to be installed, even
	  if it's older than the version currently installed on the
	  Palm.
	- Conduit declarations can have the "default" keyword.

Changes in 1.1.6:
	- Bug fix: wouldn't compile.

Changes in 1.1.5:
	- I18N: Added German and French translations.
	- Can now force installing new databases, even if this would
	  overwrite existing ones.
	- Bug fix: Locally-deleted records didn't get deleted on the
	  Palm.

Changes in 1.1.4:
	- Bug fix: a sanity check had gone horribly wrong.

Changes in 1.1.3:
	- Bug fix: ColdSync wouldn't recognize the second and
	  subsequent conduits of the same flavor.
	- Improved tutorial.
	- Weird characters in database names handled properly.
	- Improved Perl conduit API.
	- Can specify connection type (serial, USB, ...) on the
	  command line.
	- I18N: messages can now be printed in the user's native
	  language.
	- "final" conduit implemented.
	- No longer have to quote creator/type pairs in .coldsyncrc.
