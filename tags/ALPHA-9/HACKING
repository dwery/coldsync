   * * Guidelines for contributors, most important ones first: * *

- Try to leave this code as clean as you wish you had found it.

- If you're in a rush to get something done, but something isn't quite
  right, put an XXX comment (with explanation) next to it. Otherwise,
  odds are you won't be able to easily find it and fix it next week;
  certainly no one else will.

- Priorities: when you're deciding how to implement such-and-such
  feature, remember that the cardinal sin in syncing is loss of data:
  whatever you do, don't delete anything unless there's a backup
  somewhere, or you're certain that it isn't needed.
	The next issue is that things should be optimized for the
  user. In particular, try to minimize total sync time. If you have to
  choose between allocating a few Mb of memory for a cache, or making
  the user wait another second for a sync to complete, choose the
  former. Waiting is boring.

- As much as possible, if you add something, try to make it optional.
  E.g., KDE and Gnome support would be cool, but not everyone is
  running KDE or Gnome, so don't assume that they are available.

- Always compile with "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" (or the local equivalent
  of a language lawyer looking over your shoulder). If you stick to
  the rules, you're less likely to introduce some non-portability or a
  memory leak.
