 * Structure of a PADP data packet:
 *	+------+------+
 *	| type |flags |
 *	+------+------+
 *	| size        |
 *      +------+------+
 *	| <size> bytes|
 *	| of data.    |
 *      +------+------+
 *
 * Structure of a PADP ACK packet:
 *	+------+------+
 *	| type |flags |
 *	+------+------+
 *	| size        |
 *      +------+------+
 *
 * Where:
 *	'type' is the type of packet. See the PADP_FRAGTYPE_*
 *	constants, below. Of particular interest here are the 'data'
 *	and 'ack' types.
 *	'flags' are flags for the packet. Of particular interest are
 *	the 'first' flag, which indicates that this packet is the
 *	first fragment of a message, and the 'last' flag, which
 *	indicates that this is the last fragment of a message (of
 *	course, both or neither may be set).
 *	'size' indicates either the size of the message (in the first
 *	fragment), or the offset of the fragment in the message (in
 *	subsequent packets).
 *
 * The purpose of PADP is two-fold: first, as its name indicates, it
 * can break up long packets into smaller fragments, as well as
 * reassemble them afterwards.
 * Secondly, it adds reliability (which SLP doesn't provide): each
 * data packet must be acknowledged with an ACK packet (tickle packets
 * are not acknowledged). The ACK packet should have the same 'flags'
 * and 'size' field as the data packet it is in response to[1], as
 * well as the same SLP transaction ID (see "slp.h"). An ACK packet
 * should not contain any accompanying data, even if the 'size' field
 * is nonzero.
 * If the receiver cannot send an ACK immediately, it should send a
 * tickle (keepalive) packet every so often, so the connection doesn't
 * time out.
 *
 * [1] exception: the ACK packet may set the "out of memory" flag, to
 * indicate that the receiving end can't allocate enough memory to
 * receive the entire packet.
