.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <palm.h>
.Fd #include <pconn/pconn.h>

.Fn DlpReadStorageInfo "PConnection *pconn" "const ubyte card" "ubyte *last_card" "ubyte *more" "struct dlp_cardinfo *cinfo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads information about a given memory card on the Palm.
.Fa card
is the number of the memory card. Card numbers start at 0.
.Pp
.Fa last_card
is filled in with the number of the last card retrieved.

memory cards; however, this doesn't appear to be the case. This field
is currently useless.
.Pp
.Fa cinfo
is filled in with memory card information. The
.Ft dlp_cardinfo
structure is defined as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_cardinfo
{
	ubyte totalsize;
	ubyte cardno;
	uword cardversion;
	struct dlp_time ctime;
	udword rom_size;
	udword ram_size;
	udword free_ram;
	ubyte cardname_size;
