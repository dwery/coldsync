.Sh NAME
.Nm DlpCallApplication
.Nd run a program on a PalmOS device
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pa libpconn
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <palm.h>
.Fd #include <pconn/pconn.h>
.Ft int
.Fn DlpCallApplication "PConnection *pconn" "const udword version" "const struct dlp_appcall *appcall" "const udword paramsize" "const ubyte *param" "struct dlp_appresult *appresult"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
calls a Palm application via an action code.
.Pp
.Fa version
specifies the version of PalmOS on the Palm. This is because the API
of this function changed between 1.0 and 2.0. In practice, you can simply set
.Fa version
to 0x02000000 for a Palm running PalmOS 2.0 or later.
.Pp
.Fa appcall
specifies the application to run. It is of the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_appcall
{
	udword creator;
	udword type;
	uword action;
};
.Ed
where
.Fa appcall.creator
is the application's four-letter creator,
.Fa appcall.type
is its executable type, and
.Fa appcall.action
is the action code. Presumably this makes sense to people who write
PalmOS programs.
.Pp
.Fa paramsize
specifies the size of the parameter.
.Pp
.Fa param
is the parameter data.
.Pp
.Fa appresult
will be filled in with the result of running the program. It is of the
following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_appresult
{
	uword action;
	udword result;
	udword size;
	ubyte data[2048];
};
.Ed
where
.Fa appresult.action
is the action code with which the application was called,
.Fa appresult.result
is the exit value,
.Fa appresult.size
is the size of
.Fa appresult.data ,
and
.Fa appresult.data
is the returned data.

.Sh BUGS
This function has barely been tested. It may not work.
.Pp
The API could use a lot of work.
