.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm DlpOpenDB
opens an existing database on the Palm, similar to opening a file.
.Pp
.Fa card
specifies the number of the memory card on which the database is
stored. This is usually 0.
.Pp
.Fa name
specifies the name of the database to open. It is case-sensitive, and
does not include the
.Dq .pdb
or
.Dq .prc
extension.
.Pp
.Fa mode
specifies how to open the database. It is the bitwise-or of one or
more of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "LIS" -compact -offset indent
.It Dv DLPCMD_MODE_SECRET
Show private records.
.It Dv DLPCMD_MODE_EXCLUSIVE
I don't know what this does.
.It Dv DLPCMD_MODE_WRITE
Open database for writing.
.It Dv DLPCMD_MODE_READ
Open database for reading.
.El
.Pp
.Fa dbhandle
is filled in with a database handle, similar to a file descriptor,
which will be used to refer to the database in later operations.
.Pp
.Nm DlpCreateDB
creates and opens a new database on the Palm.
.Pp
.Fa newdb
is the following structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_createdbreq
{
	udword creator;
	udword type;
	ubyte card;
	uword flags;
	uword version;
	char name[DLPCMD_DBNAME_LEN];
};
.Ed
where
.Fa creator
and
.Fa type
are four-character constants, with the first character in the
most-significant eight bits;
.Fa card
specifies the number of the memory card on which to create the
database, usually 0;
.Fa flags
are the same as the
.Fa flags
argument to
.Nm DlpOpenDB ;
.Fa version
is a version number; and
.Fa name
specifies the name of the new database.
.Pp
.Fa dbhandle
is filled in with a database handle, as with
.Nm OpenDB .
.Pp
.Nm DlpCloseDB
closes the open database whose handle is
.Fa dbhandle .
If
.Fa dbhandle
is the special value
.Dv DLPCMD_CLOSEALLDBS ,
then all open databases are closed.
.Pp
.Nm DlpDeleteDB
deletes a database, which must already be closed.
.Pp
.Fa card
specifies the number of the memory card on which the database is
stored, usually 0.
.Pp
.Fa name
specifies the name of the database to delete. It does not include the
.Dq .pdb
or
.Dq .prc
extension.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
These functions all return 0 if they are successful, or a negative
value in case of error.
