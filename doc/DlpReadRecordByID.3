.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions read a record from the Palm. In all of these
functions,
.Fa pconn
is the Palm connection, as returned by
.Xr new_PConnection 3 .
.Fa handle
is a database handle, as returned by
.Xr DlpOpenDB 3 .
.Pp
If a record has been deleted and expunged (\fIi.e.\fR, when the record
was deleted and the
.Dq Save archive copy on PC
checkbox was unchecked), the length of the record's data will be given
as 0, and
.Fa data
will point to an empty string.
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadRecordByID
is the preferred way of reading a record from the Palm.
.Pp
.Fa id
specifies the identifier of the record to be retrieved; this
identifier is usually gotten with
.Fn DlpReadRecordIDList .
.Pp
.Fa offset
is the offset at which to begin reading the record: to read the record
from the beginning, use 0; to skip the first 10 bytes, use 10.
.Pp
.Fa len
specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.
.Pp
.Fa recinfo
will be filled with the record header, which has the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_recinfo
{
	udword id;
	uword index;
	uword size;
	ubyte attributes;
	ubyte category;
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa data
will be filled in with a pointer to the record data. This pointer is
to an internal buffer, and must not be freed. The length of the data
will be the smaller of
.Fa recinfo.size
and
.Fa len .
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadRecordByIndex
is less useful than it might seem. It reads the header of the
.Fa index\fRth
record, but not the record data. Thus, if you only want to read the
twelfth record in a database and nothing else, you can use
.Fn DlpReadRecordByIndex
to get the index of the twelfth record, then use
.Fn DlpReadRecordByID
to read the record's data.
.Pp
.Fa index
specifies the index of the record whose header to retrieve. Record
indices begin at 0.
.Fa recinfo ,
as with
.Fn DlpReadRecordByID ,
will be filled in with the record header.
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadNextModifiedRec
reads the next record in the database that has been modified since the
last sync (or, more accurately, since the modification flags were
reset by
.Xr DlpResetSyncFlags 3 ).
Modified records include those whose contents have changed;
those that have been moved to a different category; and those that
have been deleted, with or without an archive copy.
.Pp
.Fa handle ,
.Fa recinfo ,
and
.Fa data
are as for
.Fn DlpReadRecordByID .
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadNextRecInCategory
reads the next record in the given category.
.Pp
.Fa category
specifies the index of the category, in the range 0-15, with 0 being
reserved for the
.Dq Unused
category. The category ID can be gotten from the category list at the
start of the AppInfo block. Sadly, although the category list is in a
standard format, libpconn does not include a facility for parsing it.
.Pp
.Fa recinfo
and
.Fa data
are as for
.Fn DlpReadRecordByID .
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadNextModifiedRecInCategory
reads the next modified record in the given category. All arguments
are as for
.Fn DlpReadNextRecInCategory .
.Sh RETURN VALUE
All of these functions return 0 if successful, or a negative value
otherwise.
