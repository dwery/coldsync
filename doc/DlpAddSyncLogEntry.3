.Sh NAME
.Nm DlpAddSyncLogEntry
.Nd write sync log to a PalmOS device
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pa libpconn
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <palm.h>
.Fd #include <pconn/pconn.h>
.Ft int
.Fn DlpAddSyncLogEntry "PConnection *pconn" "const char *msg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes the sync log to the Palm. Despite its name, it does not append
to the log, it writes it. Subsequent calls have no effect.
.Pp
If the log exceeds
.Dv DLPC_MAXLOGLEN
(2048) characters, including the terminating NUL, the log message is
truncated, and only the last
.Dv DLPC_MAXLOGLEN
characters will be sent to the Palm. This is because if the log
contains error messages, they are more likely to be at the end.
.Pp
.Fa msg
specifies the log message.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Nm
return 0 if successful, or a negative value otherwise.
