.Sh NAME
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByID
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByIndex
.Nd search for records in Palm databases
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pa libpdb
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pdb.h>
.Ft struct pdb_record *
.Fn pdb_FindRecordByID "const struct pdb *db" "const udword id"
.Ft struct pdb_record *
.Fn pdb_FindRecordByIndex "const struct pdb *db" "const uword index"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByID
looks for a record in
.Fa db
whose ID is
.Fa id ,
and returns a pointer to it. Note that
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByID
does not make a copy of the record, so the pointer it returns should
not be freed with
.Nm pdb_FreeRecord ,
nor should it be added to another
.Ft struct pdb
; for this, use
.Fn pdb_CopyRecord
first.
.Pp
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByIndex
returns the
.Fa index\fRth
record in
.Fa db ,
or NULL if there are fewer than
.Fa index
- 1 records in
.Fa db .
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByID
and
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByIndex
return a pointer to the matching record, or NULL if there is none.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh LIMITATIONS
If there is more than one record in a database with the same ID (which
should never happen),
.Nm pdb_FindRecordByID
will only find the first one.
