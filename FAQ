Q: Are these *really* frequently-asked questions?
A: No. ColdSync really doesn't have enough of a following for any questions
   to have been asked often enough to become tedious. But if I had called
   this the "AQ", people wouldn't find it.

Q: Have all of these questions really been asked?
A: No. Some of the questions in this list have been added to prevent their
   being asked. But if I had called this the "Q", people wouldn't find it.

Q: Is ColdSync better than pilot-link?
A: Well, *I* think so, otherwise I wouldn't have written it.
	Seriously: technically, pilot-link is mainly a library of
   funnctions for talking to Palm devices. ColdSync includes such a library
   as well. I think that the ColdSync library is better-written, in the
   sense of being more readable (and hence more easily maintained), better
   documented, and more robust.
	The ColdSync library is not compatible with pilot-link, nor was it
   ever intended to be. At the same time, they are designed for similar
   purposes, and so share some similarities. It should be possible to port
   an application like KPilot to the ColdSync library without superhuman
   effort.

	ColdSync the application... that's a matter of taste. Most of the
   syncing applications out there seem to be clones of existing
   Windows-based applications; they require you to be logged in, and to
   have X running.
	That wasn't what I wanted. I wanted something more Unix-y. When it
   grows up, ColdSync will be a daemon started at boot time that you'll
   never need to interact with directly.
	If that's not what you're looking for, well, there are plenty of
   other applications out there. Take your pick or write your own.

Q: I've set "speed 9600;" and now all I get is timeouts.
A: This is a known, if not understood problem.
	The immediate problem is that the Palm isn't transmitting at the
   speed that ColdSync expects. Why this is so I don't know, since ColdSync
   is supposed to dictate connection speed to the Palm.
	Under PalmOS 3.3, you can set the connection speed under
   HotSync -> Connection Setup -> Direct Serial -> Edit -> Details -> Speed
	Under earlier versions, you can play with
   HotSync -> Modem Setup -> Speed

Q: Why the Artistic license? Why not the GPL?
A: Philosophical answer: because I want ColdSync to be
   freely-distributable, without the limitations that the GPL imposes. I
   believe that all software, free or otherwise, should stand or fall on
   its own merits, and not because it matches someone's agenda.
	Real answer: because I don't really care that much. What I'd really
   like to say is "Do what you like with this. Just give credit where
   credit is due." ColdSync is not commercial because, quite frankly, I
   have neither the time nor the inclination to run a business.
	I also wanted to use a "canned" license, one that many eyeballs
   have debugged. The Artistic license was closest to what I was looking
   for.

Q: I added a new ToDo/Memo/whatever category on the Palm, and it hasn't
   shown up on the desktop.
A: Yup. This is an unsolved problem.
	Categories are stored in a database's AppInfo block. The AppInfo
   block can't be synced the same way as the data records. The Palm doesn't
   report when the AppInfo block has changed, the way it does for data
   records. There doesn't seem to be a good way to synchronize the AppInfo
   block without risking losing information.

Q: Why doesn't ColdSync synchronize my preferences?
A: Preferences, such as your e-mail signature, your preferred time and date
   format, and so on, are kept in .prc files. .prc files do not lend
   themselves to syncing, for many of the same reasons as the AppInfo
   block: they don't have flags indicating whether they've changed since
   the last sync, and you can't have more than one copy of each one.

Q: Does ColdSync work with the Handspring Visor?
A: From several accounts, yes, at least under FreeBSD and Linux.
	Under FreeBSD 4.x, use /dev/ugen0 as the device, and specify
   "listen usb" in your .coldsyncrc . ColdSync should find the Visor on
   its own.

	Linux users can follow the instructions at
   http://usbvisor.sourceforge.net/Handspring-Visor-mini-HOWTO
   Then sync with /dev/ttyUSB1. In the .coldsyncrc, use "listen serial",
   since ColdSync won't be accessing the USB port directly.
	(Thanks to alert reader Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@home.com> for
   this information.)

Q: Does ColdSync support syncing via the infrared port?
A: Not directly, but yes.
	You need to install an IrCOMM handler, which will make your IR port
   behave like an RS-232 serial port. As far as I know, the only OS with a
   working IrCOMM implementation is Linux.
	Several people have reported being able to sync over IR, though I
   have so far been unable to duplicate their success. You should probably
   start with the IR-HOWTO that comes with the Redhat distribution.

Q: ColdSync doesn't detect my Visor's serial number correctly.
A: As far as I've been able to determine, the Handspring Visor does not
   allow one to get at the serial number in software.
	The Visor appears to support reading ROM tokens, which is the way
   one reads the serial number in software. It even appears to have an
   "snum" ROM token. However, the contents of this token are not a
   12-character string, but a set of 12 0xff bytes.
