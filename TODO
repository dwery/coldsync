- Error codes should probably be divided into two parts: high byte
  indicating the protocol that gave the error, and low byte giving the
  error code.
- Ideally, you should be able to use Pilot VT100 and HotSync on the
  same cradle, without having to change anything.
  More realistically, though, it'll be necessary to write a ColdSync
  daemon controller: some tool that'll allow you to turn off the
  "listen for a HotSync connection" feature, and replace it with, say,
  getty.
  OTOH, it might be possible for the daemon to listen for certain
  sequences. E.g., if it sees 0xbe, 0xef, 0xed in quick succession,
  then it's a good bet that the Palm is trying to use SLP, from which
  one can try to figure out what to do next (usually sync). Otherwise,
  wait for a <break> (or HUP?) and start 'login' on this tty, or a POP
  daemon, or whatever.
- A lot of assertion-checking would probably be a Good Thing.
- KDE korganizer just uses vCalendar format for both events and todo
  list. Uses special fields "X-PILOTID" and "X-PILOTSTAT", presumably
  for Palm syncing. Also "X-ORGANIZER:MAILTO:arensb@localhost", not
  sure what for.
- Modem, IR, network sync
- NetSync: figure out just how it works and stuff.
  Blargh. From the output of 'tcpdump', it looks as if the host with
  the databases wants to talk NetBIOS to the host with the cradle.
  Oh, well. Can always come up with a reimplementation for Unix hosts.
  That would probably be a win anyway, since it would allows us to do
  the usual Unix-y stuff, like SSL, TCP wrappers, identd etc.
- Add a type for those four-letter creator types and such.
- Something to parse version numbers, as per <System/NetMgr.h> and
  <System/SystemMgr.h>
- add_to_log() should probably also use printf() syntax, for
  convenience.
- Add identd support?
- PAM for security throughout?
- Add robustness. Ideally, ColdSync should recover from everything
  that's recoverable.
- Installing new databases: make it possible to install an older
  version of a database. (Actually, this is already possible with
  restoring.)
- Directory structure:
	~/.palm/<id>/backup	Backup of what's on the Palm
	~/.palm/<id>/archive	Old archived stuff
	~/.palm/<id>/install	Stuff to install at next sync
  where <id> is the Palm's unique ID. This is fine for the Palm III,
  but what about older ones (PalmPilot et al.)? Can the viewer ID be
  used for this? How does one create one? Generate a random number and
  hope for the best?
- Allow syslog for logging.
- Allow copious debugging to a file, including a trace of everything
  going back and forth. See tcpdump().
- Write pack()/unpack() functions a la Perl (see Kernighan and Pike,
  "The Practice of Programming," section 9.1). Use them in
  "dlp_cmd.c", to replace the blocks of
  get_ubyte()/get_uword()/get_udword() and
  put_ubyte()/put_uword()/put_udword() calls.
  Generally speaking, use these functions to replace all of the
  get_*()/put_* calls.
	Bleah. ppack()/punpack() have been written, but can't just be
  plugged in yet: some of the structures are of the form <n>, <n-byte
  string>, which means that currently, you can't just have one
  function call to unpack a whole structure.
	Just get rid of them.
- Lock files while syncing.
- The daemon ought to have some way to communicate with actual users,
  so that they can be notified when a sync starts, be asked questions,
  and other fun stuff. OTOH, since this is Unix, it ought to be able
  to run unattended.
	Possibly the best way to do this is to have the daemon listen
  on a "control" port. Clients can connect to this port and be
  notified, or control the daemon.
	Maybe a Unix domain socket is the obvious way to do it, since
  then there's no question about which machine the connection comes
  from. If it's a TCP or UDP socket, however, you can monitor syncs
  going on on another machine (useful for nosy administrators?). Here
  again, TCP is probably more secure, but UDP is less likely to cause
  a problem if something dies.
- When a new database is installed, it might contain dirty records. At
  the very least, it needs to make its way to the backup directory. Of
  course, it's silly to upload the database, then download it again
  just for the sake of syncing it. Fix the conduit API (not just
  GenericConduit) to make sense in this situation.
	Presumably this is the equivalent of a slow sync, but don't
  bother downloading the database from the Palm.
- Add convenience functions for the various RPC calls, or at least the
  more useful ones. See SysTraps.h for list of traps.
- For files that include <string.h>, fix them according to the
  'autoconf' documentation:
	#if STDC_HEADERS
	# include <string.h>		/* For memcpy() et al. */
	#else	/* STDC_HEADERS */
	# ifndef HAVE_STRCHR
	#  define strchr index
	#  define strrchr rindex
	# endif	/* HAVE_STRCHR */
	# ifndef HAVE_MEMCPY
	#  define memcpy(d,s,n)		bcopy ((s), (d), (n))
	#  define memmove(d,s,n)	bcopy ((s), (d), (n))
	# endif	/* HAVE_MEMCPY */
	#endif	/* STDC_HEADERS */
  (Done, except for libpconn/padp.c, since it already has weirdness
  for AIX. I'm not sure how the two interact.)
- Split up the doc directory into directories, one per document. (But
  see next item.)
- Combine the documentation: there's no 'libpalm' anymore, and I'm
  probably not going to have time to maintain the documentation for
  all of the various functions defined in
  {slp,padp,cmp,dlp,dlp_cmd}.c, so just strip out the function
  descriptions, and combine "libpalm.texi" with "pdb.texi" into a
  single, more general document that describes all sorts of things
  programmers ought to know about Palm formats.
- Write a few tutorials on writing conduits.
- Bug: 'coldsync -b <dir> -R' causes reset at the end of dumping
  "System"
	Fix: when opening a database with DlpOpenDB, if the database
  is read-only (ROM), don't open it for writing. In fact, Backup()
  probably shouldn't open databases read-write at all.
- Maybe add (optional) support for long arguments with libgnugetopt?
- FreeBSD's /bin/sh is still broken:
	echo "before"
	for dir in a b c; do
		test "$dir" = "." && echo "found dot"
	done
	echo "after"
  still exits right after the "done". Presumably, what needs to happen
  is for information about whether to exit with the "-e" flag to be
  carried upwards through the parse tree.
	Until this gets fixed, I don't want to use 'automake'.
- Write a 'bool has_db_extension(char *fname)' function, for convenience.
- Might be cool to have something that can deal with a "conduit
  server": a friend has just beamed you a new application; you sync;
  coldsync looks in some central repository, finds a conduit that
  handles your database type, downloads it, and runs it automatically.
	This has serious security implications, though. Perhaps one
  solution would be to have the conduit signed with PGP; set up a
  listed of trusted signers, and if the conduit doesn't come from one
  of those trusted signers, don't run it.
	A worse problem, however, is that there can be any number of
  conduits to do any number of weird things. If there are a dozen
  conduits, how does ColdSync decide which one(s) to run?
	Maybe just have a post-dump conduit installed as default for
  everything; checks its list of conduits (or maybe ~/.coldsyncrc); if
  there's no conduit listed for this database type, check some central
  repository and send mail to the user. If the entry is over a month
  old (or something), check for a newer version of the conduit.
- Should all of the .h files be lumped under #include <palm/foo.h> ?
- Perl: Write helper function to parse/pack category blocks, for
  well-behaved applications (i.e., the ones that store categories the
  same way as the built-in ones).
- Test parser with old lex and yacc. See if it's worth supporting
  them, or whether it's easier to just require flex.
- Documentation for the config file format.
- When building, make sure that #include and such find the .h files
  and libraries in this, the build directory, and not the ones in
  /usr/local that were presumably installed previously.
- Either fix the install: targets to not install "libpconn.a" and
  "libdb.a", or write man pages for all of the library functions.
- Add Makefile stuff for rerunning 'autoconf' when necessary. See node
  "Automatic Remaking" in "autoconf.info".
- Add a "group" field to the listen and conduit blocks, of the form
	group "admin";
  If a conduit belongs to a certain group, it will only be invoked if
  the current listening device is also in the same group. This way,
  the site administrator can define certain conduits that will only be
  run on a privileged cradle. This should be useful for things like
  setting up a new user's Palm.
- In daemon mode, when setting the UID, use setuid() to set both the
  real and effective UID: once it is determined that this is
  "arensb"'s Palm, we want to relinquish all of our root-ly powers and
  become as much like "arensb" as possible.
	What about setgid()?
	What's initgroups()? Is it useful?
- How does GenericConduit fit into the new conduit API? Perhaps the
  best thing to do is to have two APIs: one for built-in conduits
  (functions compiled into coldsync) and one for external programs.
  That way, the simplest conduits (generic, ignore, desktop overwrites
  Palm, Palm overwrites desktop) can be built in, and the naive user
  doesn't need to install all sorts of stuff just to try this out
  (read: can run coldsync out of the ports directory).
	When doing the main sync, if can't find any other conduit for
  a database, fall back on the built-in generic conduit.
- "Timeout. Attempting to resend" when installing AmsterdamMaps.pdb
  (166368 bytes) (from Heineken's BarTrek package).
- There appears to be a timing(?) problem with 'xcopilot',
  specifically when terminating. ColdSync thinks everything is fine,
  but 'xcopilot' hangs. I think it thinks that ColdSync hasn't
  received the final ACK. If you give the data time to drain, it
  appears to work fine, though. Maybe it's just a problem with the tty
  devices.
- Installation: allow specifying a separate directory for
  installation, for the benefit of 'depot' and 'stow'. That is, it
  should be possible to have a conduit installed as
  /usr/local/stow/coldsync-1.0.0/libexec/myconduit, but at runtime
  it'll look for the conduit as /usr/local/libexec/myconduit.
- It should be possible to have ColdSync just run the "pre-fetch"
  conduits and terminate. That way, if the user has fetch conduits
  that take a long time, he can just run them periodically from 'cron'
  and not waste time during the actual sync.
	The corollary is that it must be possible to tell ColdSync not
  to run the fetch conduits during the normal sync. Perhaps the best
  way to do this is to use something like:
	.if $FROM_CRON
		conduit fetch {
			path "/my/conduit";
		}
	.endif
	A simpler way is just to have a command-line argument
- Additional arguments on command line: if an argument is of the form
  "FOO=bar", it should set the variable FOO to the value "bar".
- Perl: methods: $pdb->append($record). $pdb->find($ID) or
  $pdb->find($record). The latter should use
  $pdb->cmp($record1,$record2) to see if two records are equal.
- Fix error messages to give some idea which database is involved.
- With BSD make, always reruns 'ar' in the library directories. Why?
  According to 'make -dm', it seems to recognize the target as a
  library.
- Rewrite GenericConduit in C, for simplicity. That way, don't have to
  check for C++ in 'configure', and can simplify the 'make depend'
  targets.
	Then again, that might make it harder to subclass.
- Perl: write a ColdSync module, to simplify writing conduits.
- Open a Unix domain socket that a client can listen on. Send
  conduits' messages to that socket. Define error codes like 22z =
  progress, so that clients can monitor how things are going.
- Use STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO (from <unistd.h>)
  where applicable.
- Having multiple Fetch conduits for the same database can be
  dangerous, since if the conduits are naive, the results of the first
  conduit will be clobbered by the second one, and so forth. Some
  solutions include:
	a) Add a flag to struct dlp_dbinfo indicating that a Fetch
	   conduit has already been run on it. Add a keyword to the
	   conduit block in .coldsyncrc saying that this conduit is
	   smart enough to cope with this. Make it an error to run a
	   second Fetch conduit on this database unless that flag is
	   set.
	b) Ignore or document the problem. Tell people not to write
	   crappy code.
- Variables set in .coldsyncrc should simply be propagated to the
  environment. Should this be done immediately, though?
- Should send mail to the user with a report of the sync.
- Merge pdb.texi and libpalm.texi into a more general TeXinfo file
  that describes the otherwise occult internals.
- "Thought of the Day" conduit: add a fortune-style message as an
  event for today, and for the next week.
- Conduit for MH alias file: look for lines of the form
	alias:	<address> Firstname Lastname
  (where the "<" and ">" are literal). If $record->{firstName} . " " .
  $record->{name} eq "Firstname Lastname", then update the e-mail
  address.
- Sync the AppInfo block. See comments in "GenericConduit.cc".
- Sync resource databases, according to the same rules as AppInfo
  blocks.
- If I ever find out what sort blocks are for, it might be a good idea
  to sync them as well.
- Perhaps status codes 6xx can be used for machine-readable
  informational messages, e.g., "NN% complete".
- Write 'mung-script' (or something) utility that takes a script
  pathname and an interpreter path, and mungs the #! path work
  properly. Make sure to use "#!/bin/sh" and not "#! /bin/sh", as per
  portability comments in 'automake' documentation.
- Bug: the argument "-dmisc" should be equivalent to "-dmisc:1".
  Currently, it's a parse error.
- Bug: For now should complain if extraneous arguments are given on
  command line.
- Fix the "todo-dump" tutorial for the new ColdSync.pm.
- Add "mh-aliases" to the tutorial.
- Include "todo-dump" and "mh-aliases" in the distribution.
- Documentation for ColdSync.pm.
- Makefile.PM and such for ColdSync.pm
- Add ColdSync.pm and friends to the BSD port.
- No-brainer configuration: make "conduit -config" part of the spec.
  Allow the user to add "CONDUITDIR=/conduit/dir" to .coldsyncrc.
  Then, when ColdSync runs, it runs "/conduit/dir/foo -config" for
  every conduit in /conduit/dir and saves the results in
  /conduit/dir/cache. /conduit/dir/cache is then read in, so that the
  configuration is the concatenation of ~/.coldsyncrc and
  /conduit/dir/cache.
	This way, if a new conduit is released, the naive user can
  just put it in /conduit/dir, and it'll work with its default
  configuration. A more sophisticated user can add a .coldsyncrc entry
  manually.
	Obviously, need the "final" flag in conduit blocks, to prevent
  unwanted conduits from running.
- Configure: make sure that C++ compiler groks 'bool' and 'static_cast'.
- Bug: the (TM) character in database names doesn't come out right:
  it's character 0x99, but in filenames it becomes %FF.
