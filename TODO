- Implement timeouts and retries in PADP.
- Documentation.
- Combine all the protocols' errnos and error messages into one?
- SLP should probably allocate memory for incoming packets, and return
  pointers into its big buffer.
- SLP and PADP should probably be able to deal with chains of buffers,
  the way the network protocol stacks deal with chains of mbufs, or
  like writev().
- Error codes should probably be divided into two parts: high byte
  indicating the protocol that gave the error, and low byte giving the
  error code.
- Ideally, you should be able to use Pilot VT100 and HotSync on the
  same cradle, without having to change anything.
- Write a class to sync two generic databases: a database is an
  ordered list of records; if they differ, they need to be synched.
  The normal case of synching a database on the palm with one on the
  desktop is just a specific subclass. Allow subclasses to override
  retrieving, comparing, storing, the logic underlying what to copy
  where, etc.
