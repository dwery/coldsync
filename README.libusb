	Some notes on running ColdSync with libusb 

$Id$


	libusb is an USB abstraction library that's used
	to write OS independent USB drivers/apps.

	The correct way to use it with coldsync is with a
	proper listen libusb block, just like this one:

	listen libusb "libusb" {
	}

	Then just launch coldsync as usual:

		coldsync --listen libusb ...

	As of coldsync 3.0, this listen block is automatically
	added unless you specify a device on the command line
	(and coldsync has been compiled with libusb support).

	If that is the case, you can launch coldsync as in

		coldsync

	Easy, isn'it ? :)
		
	
	Under Linux, udev/hotplug might try to load the visor
	driver which would conflict with colsync.

	If loaded, you should also rmmod the visor driver.

	You may also want to check that /proc/bus/usb is mounted
	and that the user has the permission to read/write
	on the USB devices. To ease the task, you can mount
	/proc/bus/usb with the option devmode=0666 .


	The libusb support has been tested with the following
	handhelds:

	Aceeca MEZ-1000		4.1.2

	Garmin iQue 3600	5.2.1r3

	Handspring Visor	3.1H2
	Handspring Treo 90	4.1H3
	Handspring Treo 270	3.5.2H5.9

	Palm m505		4.1
	Palm Tungsten T		5.2.1
	Palm Zire		4.1
	Palm Zire 31		5.2.8
	Palm Zire 72		5.2.8

	
	Support for the following units has been reported to be
	broken at this time:

	Palm Tungsten T2
	Palm Tungsten T3
