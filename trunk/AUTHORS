Andrew Arensburger <arensb@ooblick.com>: Project coordinator and
	benevolent dictator.
Louis A. Mamakos <louie@TransSys.COM>: USB support.
Mark Coletti <mcoletti@clark.net>: The original Makefile.am, which was
	then mangled out of all recognition and finally tossed.
Rob Fugina <robf@geeks.com>: Alpha-testing at personal risk to his
	data.

	A big thank you to Kenneth Albanowski and the rest of the
authors of the pilot-link code, for providing a reference
implementation.

	Justin Ferguson <jferg@lusars.net>: groveled through .h files
	to come up with a patch for misbehaving 'gcc's.
	Pace Willisson <pace@blitz.com>.
	Jorge Barros <jorge.barros@lecroy.com>: French translation.
	Christian Kirsch <ck@ix.heise.de>: German translation.
