Andrew Arensburger <arensb@ooblick.com>: Project coordinator and
	benevolent dictator.
Mark Coletti <mcoletti@clark.net>: The original Makefile.am, which has
	since been mangled out of all recognition.
Rob Fugina <robf@geeks.com>: Alpha-testing at personal risk to his
	data.

	A big thank you to Kenneth Albanowski and the rest of the
authors of the pilot-link code, for providing a reference
implementation.
