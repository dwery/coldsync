- Implement multi-fragment messages in PADP.
- SLP and PADP should probably be able to deal with chains of buffers,
  the way the network protocol stacks deal with chains of mbufs, or
  like writev().
- Error codes should probably be divided into two parts: high byte
  indicating the protocol that gave the error, and low byte giving the
  error code.
- Ideally, you should be able to use Pilot VT100 and HotSync on the
  same cradle, without having to change anything.
  More realistically, though, it'll be necessary to write a ColdSync
  daemon controller: some tool that'll allow you to turn off the
  "listen for a HotSync connection" feature, and replace it with, say,
  getty.
  OTOH, it might be possible for the daemon to listen for certain
  sequences. E.g., if it sees 0xbe, 0xef, 0xed in quick succession,
  then it's a good bet that the Palm is trying to use SLP, from which
  one can try to figure out what to do next (usually sync). Otherwise,
  wait for a <break> (or HUP?) and start 'login' on this tty, or a POP
  daemon, or whatever.
- Write a class to sync two generic databases: a database is an
  ordered list of records; if they differ, they need to be synched.
  The normal case of synching a database on the palm with one on the
  desktop is just a specific subclass. Allow subclasses to override
  retrieving, comparing, storing, the logic underlying what to copy
  where, etc.
  How do you sync two heterogenous databases (e.g., ToDo.pdb and an
  XPostitNote of things to do)?
- Add a Makefile target to build a distribution tarball. The tarball
  should consist of everyting Joe Average needs to build `coldsync',
  without requiring any of the fancy tools developers need. That is,
  the distribution tarball should contain a Makefile (built from
  Makefile.in by `autoconf') and a PostScript version of the info
  documentation (with index), so that he doesn't have to get
  `autoconf' or `makeinfo'.
  (Actually, I think `automake' takes care of this.)
- A lot of assertion-checking would probably be a Good Thing.
- (When ColdSync actually gets written:) Gnome and KDE support
- Fix PADP so it can dump when writing, as well as when reading.
- Modem sync
- NetSync: figure out just how it works and stuff.
- Add a type for those four-letter creator types and such.
- Something to parse version numbers, as per <System/NetMgr.h> and
  <System/SystemMgr.h>
- Whenever a DLPCMD function returns a variable-sized response, have
  the function that implements it take an ubyte* argument: that way,
  the caller will allocate a buffer on his own, and won't have to
  worry about freeing memory in some struct.
- Add functions InitPalmLog(), AddToPalmLog(char *), WritePalmLog(),
  to make logging work more or less the way you expect.
- Make the *_TRACE stuff go to a separate debugging log file.
