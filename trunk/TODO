- Implement multi-fragment messages in PADP.
- SLP and PADP should probably be able to deal with chains of buffers,
  the way the network protocol stacks deal with chains of mbufs, or
  like writev().
- Error codes should probably be divided into two parts: high byte
  indicating the protocol that gave the error, and low byte giving the
  error code.
- Ideally, you should be able to use Pilot VT100 and HotSync on the
  same cradle, without having to change anything.
  More realistically, though, it'll be necessary to write a ColdSync
  daemon controller: some tool that'll allow you to turn off the
  "listen for a HotSync connection" feature, and replace it with, say,
  getty.
  OTOH, it might be possible for the daemon to listen for certain
  sequences. E.g., if it sees 0xbe, 0xef, 0xed in quick succession,
  then it's a good bet that the Palm is trying to use SLP, from which
  one can try to figure out what to do next (usually sync). Otherwise,
  wait for a <break> (or HUP?) and start 'login' on this tty, or a POP
  daemon, or whatever.
- Write a class to sync two generic databases: a database is an
  ordered list of records; if they differ, they need to be synched.
  The normal case of synching a database on the palm with one on the
  desktop is just a specific subclass. Allow subclasses to override
  retrieving, comparing, storing, the logic underlying what to copy
  where, etc.
  How do you sync two heterogenous databases (e.g., ToDo.pdb and an
  XPostitNote of things to do)?
- A lot of assertion-checking would probably be a Good Thing.
- (When ColdSync actually gets written:) Gnome and KDE support
- Fix PADP so it can dump when writing, as well as when reading.
- Modem sync
- NetSync: figure out just how it works and stuff.
- Add a type for those four-letter creator types and such.
- Something to parse version numbers, as per <System/NetMgr.h> and
  <System/SystemMgr.h>
- Add functions InitPalmLog(), AddToPalmLog(char *), WritePalmLog(),
  to make logging work more or less the way you expect.
- Make the *_TRACE stuff go to a separate debugging log file.
- It should be possible to sync two Palms with each other if you have
  two cradles, or over the net.
- Add identd support?
- PAM for security throughout?
- Figure out a sane source directory organization and stick to it. I'm
  not going to worry about it too much in this alpha stage, though.
- Screw the socket idea. Just come up with a good abstraction. Get rid
  of the file descriptors, just pass pointers to PConnections.
- Figure out why 'pconn/foo' and HotSync on the Palm don't always
  finish at the same time.
- Would it be a good idea to grab as many of the identifiers from the
  Palm header files as practical, to make it easier to switch to them
  at some future point?
