	Some notes on running ColdSync as a daemon

$Id$

Introduction
============

	ColdSync can be run as a daemon. This allows one-button
operation: just plunk your Palm into its cradle and push the HotSync
button.
	There are two main ways of setting this up, depending on how
you want to connect to the Palm:

	- For a serial connection, ColdSync behaves in a getty-like
	  manner. Setting it up is similar to setting up a dumb
	  terminal on a serial line, or incoming PPP.
	  This is also used for USB under Linux. 

	- For a USB connection under FreeBSD, you'll need to add an
	  entry to /etc/usbd.conf . See README.usb for more details.


These connection types are not mutually-exclusive. A given machine can
support all two simultaneously, including multiple serial
connections.

	Actually, ColdSync doesn't really run as a standalone daemon.
Rather, it allows standard Unix utilities to connect it to a Palm. But
I still like the phrase "daemon mode."

Common Setup
====== =====

	For all three connection types, you'll need to set up two
configuration files: <prefix>/etc/coldsync.conf and <prefix>/etc/palms.
<prefix> is determined by the package installation location the builder
picked when running "configure".  By default it should be /usr/local.

	The first configuration file, <prefix>/etc/coldsync.conf ,
is optional, but it's a good idea to set it up anyway. Its format is
the same as that of ~/.coldsyncrc, which is described in coldsync(8).
This file allows you to specify conduits to run on each Palm at your
site. In addition, you can prevent users from running their own
conduits on certain database types, or any conduits at all.

	The second config file is <prefix>/etc/palms . This file is
also described in coldsync(8). It

	- maps Palm devices to users, i.e., it specifies that before
	  syncing a Palm with serial number X, username Y, and userid
	  Z, it should first setuid() to Unix user U.
	- allows you to specify a configuration file to use other than
	  ~user/.coldsyncrc . This allows you to override users'
	  preferences.

Serial Connection
====== ==========

	To set up a serial connection, treat ColdSync as you would
'getty'. If you're not sure what this means, the man page for getty(8)
should mention a configuration file in /etc that you'll need to edit.
Under FreeBSD and other BSD variants, this file is /etc/ttys, though
it may be /etc/ttytab or something else on your machine. Under System
V derivatives, you'll need to edit /etc/inittab.

* FreeBSD:

	Add a line similar to the following to /etc/ttys:

ttyd0  "/usr/local/bin/coldsync -md -s -n"	unknown on

Replace "ttyd0" with the appropriate device. If you use /dev/cuaa2 in
standalone mode, then you'll need to use "ttyd2" here.

	Note that there is a pun here: the "-n" option takes an
argument, the name of a "listen" block in the config file. 'init' will
append the tty name to the command line, so in this case, ColdSync
will be invoked as

	/usr/local/bin/coldsync -md -s -n ttyd0

Thus, you need to have a named listen block in
<prefix>/etc/coldsync.conf, with the same name as the tty:
	listen serial "ttyd0" { ... }

	Once you've edited /etc/ttys, you'll need to

	# kill -HUP 1

to tell 'init' to reread /etc/ttys . Watch for

	getty repeating too quickly on port ...

messages on the console: this is a sign that ColdSync didn't start up
properly. To debug this, try running ColdSync as root the same way as
specified in /etc/ttys, with the device as the last argument, e.g.:

	# /usr/local/bin/coldsync -md -s -n ttyd0

USB Connection
=== ==========

* Linux:

	Under Linux, the connection is done through /dev/ttyUSB<n>,
which really behaves like a serial connection. See "Serial
Connection", above, and the file README.usb.

* FreeBSD:

	Under FreeBSD, the 'usbd' daemon can spawn ColdSync. You'll
need to add the following entry to /etc/usbd.conf:

	device "Handspring Visor"
		vendor 0x082d
		product 0x0100
		release 0x0100
		attach "/usr/local/bin/coldsync -md -t usb -s ${DEVNAME}"

then kill and restart 'usbd'.

Network Connection
======= ==========

	A network connection allows your machine to accept incoming
HotSync requests. A Palm can have a "primary PC." If you sync on some
machine other than your primary PC, the host on which you're syncing
can forward the connection to your primary PC.


	You can run ColdSync either in standalone or in inetd mode.
If you use network hotsync frequently the inetd mode will be your best
option, otherwise you can use standalone.


Inetd
=====

	To run ColdSync from inetd you'll need to
edit two files: /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf .

	/etc/services (or /etc/inet/services under Solaris): Add the
following two lines: 

	netsync-wakeup	14237/udp	# Palm network hotsync wakeup
	netsync		14238/tcp	# Palm network hotsync data

unfortunately, as of this writing, the IANA has not assigned names for
these ports, so the names "netsync-wakeup" and "netsync" are made up.

	/etc/inetd.conf: Add the following line:

netsync	stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/coldsync coldsync -md --listen netsync-inetd -l /var/log/netsync.log

	then kill -HUP inetd.

Don't omit the '-l /var/log/netsync.log' section, as it's required to redirect
the standard error stream to the logfile. If omitted, the stderr will be connected
to the network socket and will break your connection.

Obviously you should have a suitable netsync-inetd profile in your
<prefix>/etc/coldsync.conf , just like this one:

	listen serial "netsync-inetd" {
		protocol: net;
		device: stdin;
		noprompt;
	}

This configuration has been tested with success. If you have any problem,
please write us a mail or check the mailing list archives for a solution.

Some users reported us they had to use the utility pi-csd from the
pilot-link package along with ColdSync to be able to succesfully
sync from the network. 


Standalone
==========

	To run ColdSync in standalone (one-shot) mode, you'll need a profile
like this one:

	listen net "netsync-standalone" {
	}

and launch ColdSync with

	coldsync -md --listen netsync-standalone
