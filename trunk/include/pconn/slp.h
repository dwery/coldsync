 * Palm's documentation can be found at
 * http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/docs/palmos/
 * under "Palm OS SDK Companion", section 9. The following is an abridged
 * version:
 *
 * Structure of a SLP packet:
 *	+------+------+------+------+------+
 *	| preamble           | dest | src  |
 *	+------+------+------+------+------+
 *	| type | size        | xid  | sum  |
 *	+------+------+------+------+------+
 *	| <size> bytes of user data        |
 *	+------+------+------+------+------+
 *	| CRC         |
 *	+------+------+
 *
 * Where:
 *	'preamble' is the mandatory 3-byte preamble to every SLP
 *	packet: the bytes 0xbe, 0xef, 0xed.
 *	'dest' and 'src' are the source and destination ports (Palm
 *	calls them "sockets". These serve to identify well-known
 *	services, much like TCP ports. See the SLP_PORT_* constants,
 *	below
 *	'type' is the type of packet. See the SLP_PKTTYPE_* constants,
 *	below.
 *	'xid' is the transaction ID of this packet. It isn't actually
 *	used by SLP, but is simply passed up to protocols higher up
 *	the stack. PADP, in particular, expects an ACK packet to have
 *	the same transaction ID as the packet to which it is a
 *	response.
 *	'sum' is a simple checksum of the SLP preamble and header
 *	(everything up to the checksum), excluding the checksum byte
 *	itself.
 *	'CRC' is a 16-bit CRC of the preamble, packet header, and user
 *	data.
 *
 * All values are unsigned.
 *
 * Error-correction:
 *	SLP is an unreliable protocol: if it receives a bad packet of
 *	any kind, its only response is to drop the packet on the
 *	floor. It is the job of protocols further up the stack
 *	(typically PADP) to ensure reliability.
 *	However, since SLP does include a checksum and CRC, if a
 *	packet is accepted, its contents are known to be good.
