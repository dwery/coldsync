.Dt DlpReadResourceByIndex 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm DlpReadResourceByIndex ,
.Nm DlpReadResourceByType
.Nd read a resource from a PalmOS device
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pa libpconn
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <palm.h>
.Fd #include <pconn/pconn.h>
.Ft int
.Fn DlpReadResourceByIndex "PConnection *pconn" "const ubyte handle" "const uword index" "const uword offset" "const uword len" "struct dlp_resource *value" "const ubyte **data"
.Ft int
.Fn DlpReadResourceByType "PConnection *pconn" "const ubyte handle" "const udword type" "const uword id" "const uword offset" "const uword len" "struct dlp_resource *value" "ubyte *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions read a resource from an open database on the Palm.
Palm resources are similar to those in the resource fork of a MacOS
file: they are identified by a four-character type, and an integer ID,
which identifies different resources of the same type (that is, there
may be multiple resource with the ID 1000, but only one CODE resource
may have the ID 1000).
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadResourceByIndex
reads the
.Fa index\fRth
resource in the database.
.Pp
.Fa handle
specifies the database handle, as returned by
.Xr DlpOpenDB 3 .
The database must already be open for reading.
.Pp
.Fa index
specifies the index of the resource from the beginning of the
database. Resource indices start at 0.
.Pp
.Fa offset
specifies the offset at which to start reading the resource: to read
the resource from the beginning, use 0; to skip the first 10 bytes,
use 10.
.Pp
.Fa len
specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.
.Pp
.Fa value
will be filled in with the resource header, which is of the following
form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct dlp_resource
{
	udword type;
	uword id;
	uword index;
	uword size;
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa data
will be filled in with a pointer to the resource data. This pointer is
to an internal buffer, and must not be freed. The length of the data
will be the smaller of
.Fa value.size
and
.Fa len .
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadResourceByType
is similar to
.Fn DlpReadResourceByIndex ,
except that you specify the resource by type and ID, rather than by
index.
.Pp
.Fa type
specifies the four-character type of the resource, with the first
letter in the most-significant 8 bits.
.Pp
.Fa id
specifies the resource identifier.
.Pp
All other arguments are as for
.Fn DlpReadResourceByIndex .
.Sh RETURN VALUE
These functions return 0 if successful, or a negative value otherwise.
