.Dt PConn_bind 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm PConn_bind
.Nd bind an address to a
.Ft PConnection
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pa libpconn
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <palm.h>
.Fd #include <pconn/pconn.h>
.Ft int
.Fn PConn_bind "PConnection *pconn" "const void *addr" "const int addrlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
associates an address with
.Fa pconn ,
which must already have been created with
.Fn new_PConnection .
.Pp
In practice, this function is not terribly useful. If
.Fa pconn
was created with
.Dv PCONN_STACK_FULL ,
use
.Bd -literal -offset
        struct slp_addr pcaddr;

        pcaddr.protocol = SLP_PKTTYPE_PAD;
        pcaddr.port = (ubyte) SLP_PORT_DLP;
        PConn_bind(pconn, &pcaddr, sizeof(struct slp_addr));
.Ed
.Pp
In all other cases,
.Fa addr
and
.Fa addrlen
are ignored. However, it is still necessary to call
.Nm
since it may have side effects.
