@section Overview
@cindex Overview
@cindex Protocol stack
@cindex PalmOS
        Communicating with a PalmOS device@footnote{PalmOS is an
operating system that runs on any number of devices, some of which are
not made by Palm Computing. We'll generally refer to a PalmOS device
simply as a ``Palm'' or from now on.} involves four protocols arranged
hierarchically:

@display
CMP DLP
 PADP
  SLP
@end display

@cindex Data integrity
        The @dfn{Serial Link Protocol} (SLP) is responsible for reading
from and writing to the serial device. It ensures data integrity and not
much else. @xref{SLP, , Serial Link Protocol}.

@cindex Reliability
        The @dfn{Packet Assembly/Disassembly Protocol} (PADP) sits on
top of SLP, and ensures reliability, @i{i.e.}, it makes sure that if a
packet is sent, it was received by the other side. @xref{PADP, , Packet
Assembly/Disassembly Protocol}.

@cindex Sync
@cindex Line discipline
        The @dfn{Connection Management Protocol} (CMP) is built on top
of PADP. It is only used briefly at the beginning of a sync, to provide
some high-level handshaking and to establish a rate at which the sync
will take place. @xref{CMP, , Connection Management Protocol}.

        Finally, the @dfn{Desktop Link Protocol} (DLP) also sits on top
of PADP, on the same level as CMP. This is the protocol that we're most
interested in, since a sync is a series of DLP exchanges between the
Palm and the desktop machine. @xref{DLP, Desktop Link Protocol}.

@cindex Desktop machine
@cindex Computationally-expensive tasks
@cindex Protocol asymmetry
        A central tenet of the Palm philosophy is that the desktop
machine has infinitely more memory and computing resources than the
Palm. Consequently, these protocols are designed so as to make things
simple for the Palm, and make the desktop responsible for any
computationally-expensive tasks, such as converting between Palm and
native byte ordering.

@section Types and Alignment
@cindex Types

@cindex Endianness
@cindex Byte order

@cindex Big-endian order
        Palm devices are big-endian; that is, integer types larger than
one byte are stored in memory most-significant byte first. This also
happens to be the network byte order of IP fame.

        The @code{libpalm} library strives to be portable, which means
that it is careful to convert between Palm and native byte order
whenever necessary.

        Unless indicated otherwise, all integer types involved in the
Palm protocol are unsigned. The three standard integer types are the
byte, word (2 bytes) and double word (4 bytes) or dword.

@cindex Types
        The file @file{palm/palm_types.h} defines several integer types:

(@code{0x00}--@code{0xff}).
@item uword
        Unsigned word (2 bytes). Can contain values in the range
0--65,535 (@code{0x0000}--@code{0xffff}).
@item udword
        Unsigned double word (4 bytes). Can contain values in the range
0--4,294,97,295 (@code{0x00000000}--@code{0xffffffff}).

@section Structure of SLP packets

A SLP packet has the following form:

@example
+------+------+------+------+------+
| preamble           | dest | src  |
+------+------+------+------+------+
| type | size        | xid  | sum  |
+------+------+------+------+------+

@hss}@hfill

@end tex
@end ignore

The @dfn{preamble} consists of the three bytes @code{0xbe}, @code{0xef},
@code{0xed}, and serves to identify the incoming packet as an SLP
packet.

The @dfn{dest} and @dfn{src} bytes correspond to IP port numbers (the
Palm documentation calls them ``socket numbers''). They are well-known
numbers and serve to identify the process on each side of the
connection. For a sync, both src and dest will be set to 3, the HotSync
port.

The @dfn{type} byte identifies the type of packet: this is a number
identifying the protocol one level up on the stack. The most common
types are 3 (loopback), which can be ignored, and 2 (PADP), which will
be passed up to the PADP protocol layer.

The @dfn{size} word gives the size of the SLP packet, not counting the
SLP header or the CRC at the end.

@cindex XID
@cindex Transaction ID
The @dfn{xid} byte is a transaction identifier. It is not used by SLP,
but rather is for the benefit of protocols higher up the stack. The PADP
protocol, in particular, expects ACK packets to have the same
transaction ID as the packet that they are in response to.

        Transaction IDs @code{0xff} and @code{0x00}(?) are reserved for
system functions.

@cindex Checksum
The @dfn{sum} byte is a checksum of the preamble and header, not
including the checksum byte itself.

The header is followed by @var{size} bytes of packet data.

@cindex CRC
@cindex Cyclic redundancy check
The packet data is followed by a two-byte cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
value, to ensure data integrity. The CRC is computed over the preamble,
header and data (@i{i.e.}, everything but the CRC word
itself).@footnote{For more information on computing the CRC, see
@cite{W. Press, S. Teukolsky @i{et al.}, ``Numerical Recipes in C: the
Art of Scientific Computing,'' 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press,
1992}. You may also be interested in knowing that the SLP CRC uses the
CCITT polynomial (0x1021) with @math{@code{jinit} = -1} and
@math{@code{jrev} = 0}.}

@cindex CRC
@cindex Data integrity
        Through its header checksum and packet CRC, SLP ensures data
integrity. That is, once you've received an SLP packet, you may be
assured that the data contained in it is good.

@cindex SLP
@cindex Reliability
        What SLP does @emph{not} provide is reliability. That is, when
you send out an SLP packet, you have no assurance that it was received
at the other end of the connection. Other protocols have to do that.

        SLP's response to bad data is simple: if a packet is bad in any
way---if it has a bad header checksum, a bad CRC, an invalid header
field, or whatever---it is simply dropped.

@cindex Packet Assembly/Disassembly Protocol

        The Packet Assembly/Disassembly Protocol (PADP) builds on SLP,
and adds reliability and fragmentation.

        @b{Note:} most of this chapter is for informational use only,
since the more sophisticated features of PADP have not yet been
implemented in @code{libpalm}.

@section Structure of PADP Packets

        A PADP packet looks as follows:

@example
+------+------+------+------+
| type |flags |  size       |
+------+------+------+------+
| <size> bytes of data      |
+------+------+------+------+
@end example

The @dfn{type} byte specifies the type of the packet. The main types are
data (1), indicating that this packet carries user data; ACK (2),
indicating that this packet is an acknowledgement of some other packet;
and `tickle' (4), which is sent periodically to keep the connection from
timing out if there is a long delay.

The @dfn{flags} field specifies flags for the packet. The main ones are
0x80, which indicates that this is the first packet in a message, and
0x40, which indicatest that this is the last packet in a message.

The header is followed by @code{size} bytes of data.

@c ==================================================
@node PADP Exchanges,  , PADP Structure, PADP
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section PADP Exchanges

@c ----------------------------------------
@subsection Packet Acknowledgment
@cindex ACK
@cindex Acknowledgement
@cindex XID
@cindex Transaction ID
        Each packet sent out with PADP requires an acknowledgement (ACK)
packet. The ACK packet has the same flags and size fields as the
original packet, but has a type of ACK, and carries no data (even though
the size field indicates that it should). Furthermore, the SLP
transaction ID of the ACK packet should match that of the original
packet.

        Thus, PADP adds reliability to SLP: when the sender receives an
ACK, it knows that the packet was received correctly. Note that PADP
does not ensure data integrity: that is done by SLP.

@c ----------------------------------------
@subsection Retransmission
@cindex Timeout
@cindex Retransmit
        When the sender sends out a packet, it waits for an ACK. If no
ACK has been received within a certain amount of time (2 seconds by
default), it retransmits the packet and again waits for an ACK. After a
certain number of attempts (14 by default), the sender concludes that
the other end is dead and gives up.

@subsection Fragmentation and Reassembly
@cindex Fragmentation
@cindex Reassembly

        @strong{Caution:} this part of PADP is not yet implemented in
the @code{libpalm} library. The following information is just to give
the reader a more complete overview of PADP.

        A single PADP packet can only carry 1024 bytes (1Kb) of payload
data. If a sender wishes to send a longer message than that, it is
PADP's job to break that message up into 1024-byte fragments on the
sending end, and to reassemble them on the receiving end.

        This fragmentation makes it easier to transmit long messages in
an unreliable environment: if one bit of a 20Kb message is corrupted
during transmission, the entire 20Kb would have to be resent. If it is
broken up into 1Kb fragments, then only the corrupted fragment needs to
be resent.

        Each fragment is sent and acknowledged in turn. That is, 
@display
Sender sends fragment 1
Recipient acknowledges fragment 1
Sender sends fragment 2
Recipient acknowledges fragment 2
@c XXX - Why is the ellipsis outdented in the printed manual?
@dots{}
Sender sends fragment @i{n}
Recipient acknowledges fragment @i{n}
@end display

        In the first fragment, the @code{size} field indicates the size
of the entire message. The `first fragment' flag in the @code{flags}
field is set, and the `last fragment' flag is clear.

        In subsequent fragments, the @code{size} field indicates not the
size of the fragment, but rather its offset in the full message. In the
@code{flags} field, both the `first fragment' and `last fragment' flags
are clear.

        In the last fragment, the @code{size} field indicates the offset
of the fragment in the full message. In the @code{flags} field, the
`first fragment' flag is clear, and the `last fragment' flag is set.

@cindex Connection Management Protocol

        The Connection Management Protocol (CMP) is used for negotiating
the parameters of a connection with a Palm, in particular the speed of
the connection. It is only used, briefly, at the beginning of a sync
session.

        CMP sits on top of PADP on the protocol stack.

@section Structure of CMP packets

        CMP packets have the folllowing structure:

@example
+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| type |flags |verMaj|verMin| unused      |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| rate                      |

        @hrule}@kern-0.4pt}
@let@bytebox=@xbytebox

@bytebox{1}{type}
@bytebox{1}{flags}
@end tex
@end ignore

@cindex Wakeup packet
@cindex Init packet
@cindex Abort packet
The @code{type} field specifies what type of packet this is:

@table @r
@item 1
Wakeup
@item 2
Init
@item 3
Abort
@end table

The @code{flags} field specifies flags for the packet. The meaning of the
flags varies depending on the packet type:

@table @r
@item Wakeup flags:
        A wakeup packet does not have any flags set.
@item Init flags:
        @table @code
        @item 0x80

        Change rate: if the sender of the init packet has changed the
        rate from that suggested in the wakeup packet, this flag must be
        set in the init packet.

        @item 0x40
        (v1.1 extension) Set receive timeout to 1 minute.

        @item 0x20
        (v1.1 extension) Set receive timeout to 2 minutes.

        @end table
@item Abort flags:
        These flags give the reason for aborting the sync.
        @table @code
        @item 0x80

        Protocol mismatch: the sender of the abort packet is incapable
        of handling the protocol version given in the wakeup packet.

        @end table
@end table

@cindex Protocol version
The @code{verMaj} and @code{verMin} fields give the major and minor
version number of the sync communication protocol that the sender is
using. This lets the receiver avoid using features that the sender does
not understand.

@cindex Pilot 5000
@cindex PalmPilot
        The Pilot 5000 (and, presumably, older models) uses version 1.0.
The PalmPilot uses version 1.1.

@cindex Connection rate
The @code{rate} field is a connection rate, in bits per second (bps). In
a `wakeup' packet, this is the highest speed at which the sender is
willing to communicate.

@c ==================================================
@node CMP Negotiation,  , CMP Structure, CMP
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section CMP Negotiation
@cindex Rate negotiation

@cindex Initial rate
@cindex Rate, initial
        CMP is used to negotiate a connection rate between two devices.
The rate negotiation itself takes place at 9600 bps, by convention.

        First, the client (the Palm) sends a `wakeup' packet to initiate
a connection with the server (the desktop machine).

@cindex Wakeup packet
@cindex Protocol version
        The `wakeup' packet specifies the version of the communication
protocol that the Palm is using, as well as the highest speed at which
the Palm is willing to communicate.

@cindex Init packet
@cindex Protocol version
        The desktop then sends back an `init' packet, giving the version
of the communicaton protocol that it is using, as well as the speed at
which it will be communicating.

        If the desktop picks a speed other than the one in the `wakeup'
packet, it must set the `rate change' flag (0x80) in its `init' packet.

        Both the protocol version and the speed may be given as 0,
meaning ``whatever we're using right now.'' This leaves the speed at
9600 bps.

+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| <size> bytes of data                    |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+
@end example

The @var{id} field specifies the argument's type. This is similar to
specifying the type of a function argument in a language like C.

The @var{size} field specifies the length of the data following the
argument header.

@c ----------------------------------------
@subsection Differentiating Argument Types

@cindex Argument size
        The three argument types differ in the amount of payload data
they can hold: tiny arguments can hold up to 256 bytes of data, small
arguments can hold up to 64Kb of data, and long arguments can hold up to
4Gb of data.

@cindex Long argument
        Long arguments are not yet used; they are a planned extension
for version 2.0 of the sync communications protocol. Furthermore, even
then the Palm will not originate long arguments, although it will accept
them.

        The three types of argument can be differentiated by their
@var{id} field: tiny and small argument IDs are one byte long, and their
two most significant bits are set to @code{00} and @code{01}
respectively. Long arguments' IDs are two bytes long, and their two most
significant bits are @code{11}.
