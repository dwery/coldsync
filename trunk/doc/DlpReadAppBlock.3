.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm DlpReadAppBlock
reads the AppInfo block of a database on the Palm. The database must
already be open for reading.
.Pp
.Fa handle
is the database handle given by
.Nm DlpOpenDB .
.Pp
.Fa offset
indicates the offset at which to start reading. This should be 0 to
read from the beginning of the AppInfo block.
.Pp
.Fa len
indicates the maximum number of bytes to read.
.Pp
.Fa size
is filled in with the number of bytes actually read.
.Pp
.Fa data
is filled in with a pointer to a buffer containing the data read. This
buffer is volatile, so the data should be copied before the next DLP
function call.
.Pp
.Nm DlpWriteAppBlock
writes a database's AppInfo block. If the database already had an
AppInfo block, it is erased.
.Pp
.Fa handle
is the database handle given by
.Nm DlpOpenDB .
.Pp
.Fa len
specifies the length of the new AppInfo block.
.Pp
.Fa data
is a pointer to the new AppInfo block.
.Pp
.Nm DlpReadSortBlock
and
.Nm DlpWriteSortBlock
are similar to
.Nm DlpReadAppBlock
and
.Nm DlpWriteAppBlock ,
but affect the database's sort block instead of its AppInfo block.
