	* include/pconn/PConnection.h: Add flag PCONNFL_MODEM.

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: Copy flags into pconn->flags rather than
	passing it to the pconn_*_open functions, as it is required in other
	functions for modem support.

	* libpconn/Pconnection_net.c: Function definition change for open
	and use pconn->flags rather than flags.

	* libpconn/Pconnection_serial.c: Function definition change for open
	and use pconn->flags rather than flags, serial_write to STDOUT_FILENO
	if pconn->fd == STDIN_FILENO, don't do any setspeed if flags &
	PCONNFL_MODEM.  Special case device string 'stdin' means read from 
	stdin (note: linux has a /dev/stdin, but this is more portable)

	* libpconn/Pconnection_usb.c: Function definition change for open
	and use pconn->flags rather than flags.

	* src/coldsync.c: Read the user config file in run_mode_Daemon if it's
	provided on the command line, re-write flags from LISTENFL_* to 
	PCONNFL_* during new_PConnection so they don't have to be kept in sync.

	* src/coldsync.h: Added LISTENFL_MODEM for modem support.

	* src/lexer.l: Added MODEM keyword literal string 'modem'.

	* src/palment.c: Wildcards for the columns serial ('' or '*'),
	username ('' or '*'), userid (0) such that they match any palm.

	* src/parser.y: token MODEM sets flag LISTENFL_MODEM on the current
	listen block if seen.

	* doc/Makefile: When installing man pages, looks for synonyms in
	the file, and installs them as symlinks.

	* libpconn/palm_errno.c: Added PALMERR_TIMEOUT2 case to
	palm_strerror().

	* libpconn/netsync.c: netsync_read_method() now waits for input

	should help with dropped data under Linux.

	* libpconn/dlp_cmd.c: Dlp*() functions now use dlp_dlpc_req().

	* libpconn/dlp.c: dlp_send_req() now takes const arguments. Added
	dlp_dlpc_req(), a wrapper for sending DLP commands and getting an
	answer back.

	* src/lexer.l: Added "hostid" keyword.

	* src/config.c: Initialize hostid to 0.

	* src/coldsync.c: Get host ID after parsing config file, since it
	might set the host ID.

	* i18n/Makefile: Echo before creating directories, for
	explicitness.

	* doc/Makefile: Added quotes, out of paranoia.

	* conduits/Makefile: Echo what it's doing, to make 'make install'
	logs more explicit.

	weren't comparing the right values. Patch submitted by Alessandro
	Zummo.

	under Solaris and DU.

	* configure.in: Added --without-ipv6 option, mainly for Solaris.

	* README: Added a complaint about DEC's linker.

	for boolean options.

	* src/config.c: global_opts.force_install and

	"Undefined", and allow the config file to override values that
	weren't set on the command line.

	* src/coldsync.h: Added Bool3 type. global_opts.force_install and
	global_opts.install_first are now 'Bool3's. Added options to
	struct sync_config, for the options block. Added declaration for
	Bool3str().

	* src/coldsync.c: Pass flags to new_PConnection().
	global_opts.force_install and global_opts.install_first are now

	keywords. (Still buggy.)

	* src/lexer.l: Moved the variable name pattern after the keyword
	patterns, so that keywords keywords take precedence.
	* AUTHORS: Added Bob Geer.

2001-11-07  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpdb/pdb.c (bug fix): Changed some offsets from uword (bug!)
	and udword (non-bug) to localID, since that's how they're
	represented in struct pdb. Bug reported and fix suggested by Bob
	Geer <bgeer@xmission.com>

	* libpconn/spc_client.c: Trace statements used to be printed
	unconditionally. Turned them into more conventional IO_TRACE()
	statements.

2001-11-04  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/slp.c (bug fix): Removed bogus close(). It'd be nice to
	fix this better, but that's too hard right now.

2001-10-17  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 2.2.3 released.

	* src/parser.y: Optional colons are now mandatory (it's about
	time).

	* src/config.c: Removed use of do_{backup,restore},
	{backup,restore}dir in global_opts. Fixed getopt() call
	accordingly. Added -P option to usage string.

	* src/coldsync.c: Removed use of do_{backup,restore},
	{backup,restore}dir in global_opts. The -b and -r options are
	dead.

	* src/coldsync.h: Removed do_{backup,restore}, {backup,restore}dir
	from global_opts.

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added mention of -P option and "protocol:"
	directive. Removed mention of obsolete -b and -r options.

	software protocol.
	
	* src/parser.y: Removed USB_M50X listen type.

	for make_c_string(). Added some "to do" comments.

	* src/parser.y: Fixed improperly-merged lex_expect() calls.

	* src/parser.h: Added LEX_VAR start state, for variable names.

	* src/config.c: Undid my fix: no need to duplicate value passed to
	put_symbol().

	* libpconn/netsync.c: Added "to do" comment. Made a trace
	statement conditional.

2001-10-14  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	generation.
	(bug fix): Fixed infinite loop.

2001-10-12  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 2.2.2 released.

2001-10-11  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	Incorporated Fred Gylys-Colwell's patches:

	* README: Updated version number.

	* src/symboltable.h: Added __cplusplus guard.

	* libpdb/Makefile: Use tab instead of space.

	* config.h.in: Added c_plusplus.

	* src/parser.y: Set variable strings to NULL on parser stack after
	storing in symbol table.

	* src/config.c: Don't store static string in symbol table.

	* configure.in: Added check for access().

	* src/symboltable.cc: Added some warning comments.

	* src/parser.h: Added LEX_VAR start state. Added lex_tini().

	* doc/coldsync.8: Incorporated options{} and variable
	documentation from "fred" branch.

	* doc/sample.coldsync.rc: Added example of option{} block.

	* src/parser.y: Added options{} block.

	* src/lexer.l: Added symbol table support. Added "options"
	keyword.

	* src/conduit.c: Include symbol table support. Better error
	logging.

	* src/config.c: Added symbol table: "-l logfile" sets the LOGFILE
	symbol. Added casts to printf("%p") statements to make gcc shut
	up.

	* src/conduit.c: Replaced Fred's exec_from_path() with
	find_in_path(). Use execv(), not execvp(): if find_in_path()
	didn't find it, don't bother looking in $PATH.

	* src/lexer.l: Added 'qstring', 'qstr_*' variables, qstr_clear(),
	qstr_append(). Added lex_tini(). Added LEX_VAR start state.
	Removed YY_NO_UNPUT and YY_NEED_STRLEN, since we now use unput()
	and yyless(), respectively. Added character classes for variable
	names and ordinary characters in strings. Redid Fred's
	double-quoted strings with qstr_append(), for cleanliness. Check
	variable interpolations for sanity. Variables can now be either
	$(VAR) or ${VAR}. Strings may now contain escaped characters (all
	the ones allowable in C strings), octal (\0123) and hex (\x3f)
	characters. Attempt to find runaway strings.

	* src/symboltable.cc: Made make_c_string() static, and added
	forward declaration, so it'll compile cleanly.

	* src/parser.y: Removed some "to do" comments. Yay! In options{}
	block, now knows that variable names should look like variable
	names, not quoted strings or ordinary barewords. Clean up after
	lexer.

	* src/parser.h: Added LEX_VAR start state. Added lex_tini(), to
	clean up after lexer.

	* src/coldsync.c: Rehabilitated global_opts.log_fname. Fixed
	logging to a file: fixed open_log_file() so that it can be called
	multiple times and do the Right Thing. Open the log file twice:
	once after command-line options are parsed, and once after the
	config file is parsed, in case the config file specified a new log
	file. Fixed the test to determine whether or not to log the
	closing of the log file. open_log_file() now returns -1 instead of
	1 in case of error.

	* src/coldsync.h: Rehabilitated global_opts.log_fname.

	* src/coldsync.c (bug fix): Prevent memory from being free()d
	twice.

	* src/config.c: Set log file both ways (both in global_opts, and
	as a symbol in the symbol table). This is but temporary.

	* src/config.c: Un-split the long usage string, since IMHO it
	makes sense to do it differently.

2001-10-10  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/Makefile: Added symboltable.{h,cc}

	* src/log.c: Removed logging to stderr (unnecessary).

	* src/symboltable.h: Fixed up comments to fit my style. Enclosed
	the whole thing in 'extern "C"'

	* src/symboltable.h, src/symboltable.cc (added): Functions for
	manipulating symbol table.

	* libpconn/netsync.c: Re-added comments, ritual_*_size constants
	that got lost in the shuffle.
	(bug fix): wasn't sending ritual response 3
	properly.

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: Changed "fname" to "device", for
	consistency with other related functions.

	* include/pconn/Makefile: Added spc_client.h.

	* libpconn/Makefile: Added spc_client.c.

	* libpconn/spc_client.c (added): Definitions for SPC client.

	* include/pconn/spc_client.h (added): Declarations for SPC client.

	* include/pconn/netsync.h: Removed ritual statement lengths.

	* libpconn/netsync.c: Ritual statements are static, since they're
	only used here.

	* src/misc.c, libpdb/pdb.c, libpconn/slp.c,
	libpconn/PConnection_net.c: #include <strings.h> on those machines
	that have it.

	* src/spalm.c: #include <strings.h>, on those systems that need
	it.

	* src/GenericConduit.cc: Took out extraneous add_to_log() calls.
	Removed Fred's "local_changed" and "remote_changed" variables: not
	really useful.

2001-10-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpdb/Makefile, libpconn/Makefile: Added ${OTHERTAGFILES} to
	build TAGS file correctly.

	* Make.rules.in: Get CONDUITDIR from 'configure'.

	* config.h.in: Added HAVE_BCOPY

	* configure.in: Add standard CPPFLAGS to look for headers and
	libraries in $prefix only if $prefix isn't /usr: this confuses
	gcc. Add test for bcopy(). Added --with-conduits=DIR, to specify
	where conduits should be installed.

	* config.h.in: Added CONDUITDIR.

	END OF FRED'S PATCHES

	- Version 2.2.1 released.

	* i18n/it.po, i18n/fr.po, i18n/de.po: Latest version of strings.
	
	* libpconn/netsync.c: Added some "to do" comments, more logging.
	
	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: Added some "to do" comments, more
	logging.

	* doc/libpdb.3: First draft of documentation for libpdb.

	* configure.in: Bumped up version number. Don't use
	-I${prefix}/include or -L${prefix}/lib if $prefix is /usr, since
	that confuses gcc. Added check for access(). Added
	--with-conduits=DIR option.

2001-10-06  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/restore.c: Replaced add_to_log() calls with va_add_to_log().
	No longer refuses to upload read-only database: rather, lets the
	user shoot himself in the foot: if the database already exists
	(and is read-only), then DlpDeleteDB() should fail, and so will
	the upload.

	* src/log.c: Removed 'synclog' and add_to_log(). Replaced with
	va_add_to_log().

	* src/install.c: Replaced add_to_log() calls with va_add_to_log().
	(bug fix): Turn off read-only flag when uploading database, otherwise
	it's impossible to delete it.

	* src/coldsync.h: Replaced add_to_log() with va_add_to_log().

	* src/coldsync.c: Got rid of 'synclog' and all the crud associated
	with uploading the sync log only at the end of the script. Use
	va_add_sync_log().

	* src/backup.c: Replaced add_to_log() calls with va_add_to_log().
	* src/GenericConduit.cc: Replaced add_to_log() calls with
	va_add_to_log().

	* libpconn/dlp_cmd.c (bug fix) DlpAddSyncLogEntry() doesn't
	include the trailing NUL as part of the log message, so when you
	say to add a log message, it really does that.

	* i18n/it.po, i18n/fr.po, i18n/de.po: Latest version of strings.
	Updated for va_add_to_log().

2001-09-29  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/config.c: Casts to shut up gcc 3.

	* Make.rules.in: Added CONDUITDIR from 'configure'.

	* libpconn/PConnection_serial.c (bug fix): check speeds: if either

	numbers) and dlprpc_argtype_t
	(for RPC argument types). Updated DLPRPC_param accordingly.

	now-obsolete palm_errrlist[] and palm_numerrs.

	* include/pconn/palm_errno.h: Added type palmerr_t for libpconn
	status/error codes. Changed palm_errno to palmerr_t. Added
	declaration for palm_strerror().

	* src/spalm.c, src/restore.c, src/install.c, src/coldsync.c,
	src/backup.c, src/GenericConduit.cc, libpconn/dlp_cmd.c: Use

	new_PConnection().

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h: Defined new types: pconn_listen_t
	and pconn_proto_t; redefined functions accordingly.

	* src/spc.h: Defined enums for SPCOP_* and SPCERR_* constants. Not
	as useful as might be hoped, but every bit counts.

2001-09-06  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/coldsync.c: Updated declaration of 'cs_errno'.

	* src/cs_error.h: Made a separate enum for 'cs_errno', and made it
	its own type, the better to catch untested cases.

	* FAQ: Updated information about Visor.

2001-09-05  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* doc/Makefile: Added the new function man pages to distribution;

	pages.

2001-08-22  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/spalm.c: Removed an "&". Not sure why. Probably because it
	makes no difference, but some compiler complained.

	* config.h.in: Added entry for bcopy.

	* README: Updated for 2.2.0

	* Make.rules.in: Added directory for function (section 3) man
	pages.

2001-08-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: Added Palm to list of expected
	vendors, along with Handspring.

2001-08-15  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* doc/Makefile: Split $INFOFILES int $INFOFILES (foo.info) and
	$EXTRA_INFOFILES
	(foo.info-*) to work around 'make' complaints when there are no files
	matching "*.info-*".

	* src/conduit.c (bug fix): Fixed improper cut & paste.

	* src/conduit.c (bug fix): Error message didn't perform sufficient
	error-checking, dumped core.

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: Renamed "fname" argument to "device",
	for semi-consistency and creamy nougat filling.

2001-08-05  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/spalm.c, src/misc.c, libpdb/pdb.c, libpconn/slp.c,
	libpconn/PConnection_net.c: Include <strings.h>. It might be
	necessary.

	* configure.in: Added test for bcopy().

2001-08-03  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/GenericConduit.cc (bug fix): SyncRecord didn't handle
	correctly the case where a record has changed both on the Palm and
	the desktop. Added some trace statements.

2001-08-02  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/netsync.c, include/pconn/netsync.h: Moved ritual packet
	declarations wholly into netsync.c, since they don't need to be
	anywhere else.

2001-07-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 2.2.0 released.

	* i18n/it.po, i18n/fr.po, i18n/de.po: Latest version of strings.

	* libpconn/PConnection_usbm50x.c: Added i18n support. Let
	ritual_exch_server() do ritual packet exchange, instead of doing
	it manually. pconn_usbm50x_open() now takes and sets protocol.
	However, this module should go away soon.

	* libpconn/PConnection_net.c: Moved the ritual packet exchanges
	into their own functions. pconn_net_open() checks and sets the
	protocol. The various methods now check pconn->protocol and act
	accordingly.

	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: pconn_usb_open() checks and sets the
	protocol. The various methods now check pconn->protocol and act
	accordingly.

	* libpconn/PConnection_serial.c: pconn_serial_open() checks and
	sets the protocol.
	The various methods now check pconn->protocol and act accordingly.
	This means that "serial" with protocol=simple should subsume the
	usb_m50x stuff.

	* libpconn/netsync.c: Added ritual_exch_server(),
	ritual_exch_client(). Minor cleaning.

	* src/coldsync.c: Added support for specifying protocol in
	.coldsyncrc or command line. Pass this on to new_PConnection().

	* src/lexer.l: Added keywords relating to "protocol:" directive,
	including the names of the various protocols. Rearranged keywords
	a bit.

	* src/parser.y: Added rule for "protocol: <protocol>;" inside
	listen {} blocks.

	* src/spc.c: Reduced verbosity.

	* src/config.c: Added "-P <protocol>" option. Fixed typo. Added
	name2protocol().

	* src/coldsync.h: Added 'protocol' command-line option.

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: The pconn_<dev>_open() functions now
	take a 'protocol' argument. new_PConnection() takes one, too, but
	just passes it along to pconn_<dev>_open().

	* include/pconn/netsync.h: Added declarations for ritual packet
	exchange functions.

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h: Added symbols for "software"
	protocol stacks. Added protocol field to struct PConnection.
	new_PConnection() now takes a protocol argument.

	* conduits/copy-appinfo: Commented out a trace statement.

2001-07-28  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* AUTHORS: Added Mike Durian.

	* libpconn/netsync.c: Use (*pconn->io_read)(), for proper
	object-orientedness. (bug fix): Incorporated fix by Mike Durian
	<durian@boogie.com>: initialize netsync input buffer before use.

	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: Use memcpy() instead of bcopy()
	(it's more standard).

2001-07-26  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/PConnection_usbm50x.c: Added Emacs magic.

2001-07-25  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/parser.y, src/lexer.l: Added "usb_m50x" keyword.

	* libpconn/netsync.c, include/pconn/netsync.h: Changed "no_header"
	argument from int to 'const Bool', since that's what was meant.

	* AUTHORS: Added Koen Deforche.

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h, include/pconn/netsync.h,
	libpconn/Makefile, libpconn/PConnection.c,
	libpconn/PConnection_net.c, libpconn/PConnection_usbm50x.c,
	libpconn/netsync.c, src/config.c, include/pconn/pconn.h,
	doc/coldsync.8: Incorporated Koen Deforche's M50x patch.

2001-07-15  Koen Deforche <kdf@irule.be>

        * PConnection.h, netsync.h, libpconn/Makefile, PConnection.c,
	  PConnection_net.c, PConnection_usbm50x.c, netsync.c, config.c:

	  Support for Palm m50x USB cradle (Linux).

2001-07-11  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/dlp_cmd.c, include/pconn/dlp_cmd.h: Fixed
	DlpWriteNetSyncInfo() API so it doesn't suck as bad.

2001-07-09  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* include/pconn/dlp_cmd.h, libpconn/dlp_cmd.c: Got rid of bogus
	struct dlp_readrecret.

	* Make.rules.in: Take CXXFLAGS from configuration. Why wasn't this
	done before?

	* include/pconn/dlp_cmd.h: Rearranged into sections, one per DLP
	call. Added some missing flags and whatnot. General cleanup.

	* configure.in: Changed version number (tag) for development
	branch.

2001-07-06  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* include/pconn/pconn.h: Added declaration for crc16().

	* libpconn/Makefile: Added crc.c to source. Generate .o files via
	a macro, instead of listing them individually.

	* libpconn/slp.c: Took out some useless #includes.

	* libpconn/util.c, include/pconn/util.h: Moved CRC-related stuff
	elsewhere, since this file is effectively shared with libpdb.

	* libpconn/crc.c (added): Moved CRC-related stuff into a separate
	file.

2001-07-02  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpdb/pdb.c: More verbose error messages: where possible,
	indicate which database they pertain to.

2001-06-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	-- On stable branch:

	- Version 2.1.3 released.

	* AUTHORS: Added Alessandro Gatti.

	* i18n/Makefile: Added Italian to list of languages.

	* palm.c (bug fix, #41): Fixed off-by-one error when appending
	records to dblist.
	(If you installed a file by putting it in ~/.palm/install, the
	database list got messed up, and the main sync failed and dumped
	core.)

	-- End stable branch.

2001-06-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: "PConnection.h" will eventually get
	installed in /usr/include, so moved all of the
	"config.h"-dependent stuff out of there and into here.

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h: Since this file will eventually be
	installed in /usr/include, removed all of the stuff that obviously
	depends on "config.h", and moved it to PConnection.c.

	* src/spalm.c (bug fix, #41): Fixed off-by-one error when
	appending records to dblist.
	(If you installed a file by putting it in ~/.palm/install, the
	database list got messed up, and the main sync failed and dumped
	core.)

2001-06-26  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* include/Makefile: Added palm.h to distribution.

	* src/palm.h: Renamed to spalm.h.
	* src/palm.c: Renamed to spalm.c

	* include/pconn/palm_types.h (deleted): Obsolete. This file's
	functionality has been taken over by <palm.h>.

	* include/palm.h (added): A more global replacement for
	<pconn/palm_types.h>.

	* libpconn/padp.c, libpconn/dlp.c, libpconn/cmp.c,
	libpconn/PConnection_usb.c, include/pconn/util.h,
	include/pconn/slp.h, include/pconn/padp.h,
	include/pconn/netsync.h, include/pconn/dlp_rpc.h,
	include/pconn/dlp_cmd.h, include/pconn/dlp.h:
	<pconn/palm_types.h>'s declarations moved to <palm.h>, so #include
	that instead.

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h, i18n/Makefile: Added
	Italian to list of languages.

	* AUTHORS: Added Alessandro Gatti.

	* src/spalm.h (renamed): This used to be "palm.h"

	* src/GenericConduit.cc: Use download_database() instead of
	pdb_Download().

	* src/coldsync.h: Added declarations for
	{upload,download}_database().

	* src/backup.c: Moved pdb_Download(), pdb_DownloadResources(),
	pdb_DownloadRecords() here as download_database(),
	download_resources(), download_records(). Changed some PDB_TRACE()
	calls to SYNC_TRACE().

	* src/install.c: Moved pdb_Upload() to here, as upload_database().

	* libpdb/pdb.c: Moved pdb_Download(),
	pdb_Download{Records,Resources}(), and pdb_Upload() to the main
	ColdSync source tree.

	* include/pdb.h: Moved pdb_Download() and pdb_Upload() to the main
	ColdSync source tree. Removed #include of a libpconn header (which
	was only needed for pdb_{Up,Down}load(). Removed obsolete
	declaration of UploadDatabase().

2001-06-10  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/config.c (bug fix): Fixed print_pda_block(): if the PDA has
	a special serial number ("*Visor*"), don't print a checksum in the
	suggested PDA block.

2001-06-04  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/coldsync.c: Collapsed two similar strings, for translators'
	benefit.

	* src/config.c (bug fix): Don't use $HOME when looking for
	.coldsyncrc: it's inherited from usbd (and possibly inetd) in
	daemon mode. Brought usage message up to date. More explicit error
	messages.

	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: Added trace statement.

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added mention of one-preference bug.

	* doc/Makefile: Added *.info-* to list of auto-generated files
	(for "make clean").

	typos. Added colon in .coldsyncrc examples. Added mention of Sync
	and Install conduits in introductory section. Added mention of
	Install conduits in specification section. Added mention of
	preferences. Removed some obsolete and/or incoherent parts.
	Officially mention that all-whitespace header values are possible.
	Updated menus.

2001-05-05  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/coldsync.c (bug fix): Fixed misleading status message when a
	slow/fast sync was forced.

	* src/coldsync.c (bug fix): Don't call Disconnect() after losing
	connection to Palm, since Disconnect() tries to send packets.

	* libpconn/PConnection_serial.c: Added usleep() for those OSes
	that don't already have it. Use usleep() to let the serial driver
	settle down after tcsetattr(), rather than sleep().

	* config.h.in, configure.in: Added check for usleep().

	* libpconn/netsync.c (design fix): Use io_write() instead of
	write().

	* libpconn/slp.c (bug fix): Linux's serial USB driver doesn't
	appear to handle two-byte packets gracefully. Fixed slp_write() to
	send the whole packet at once.

	* libpconn/padp.c: Mostly cosmetic. padp_write() now uses
	PALMERR_ACKXID.

	* libpconn/PConnection_usb.c: Updated for new io_write()
	signature.

	* libpconn/PConnection_serial.c: Updated for new io_write()
	signature. Changed sleep(1) to usleep(50000).

	Oops! Updated for new io_write() signature.

	* include/pconn/palm_errno.h: Added error code.

	* include/pconn/PConnection.h: io_write() now takes const
	arguments.

	* INSTALL: Fixed Sun instructions.

2001-04-14  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* libpconn/slp.c (design fix): slp_write() used write(), rather
	than io_write().

	when both system-wide and personal config files existed. Bug found
	by Alex Tronin <at@urbis.net>.

2001-03-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/coldsync.c: Better error-checking.

	* libpconn/slp.c: Somewhat better error-recovery: close Palm file
	descriptor and set it to -1 when there's an unrecoverable error.

	* libpconn/cmp.c (bug fix): cmp_accept incorrectly didn't set the
	CMP_IFLAG_CHANGERATE flag. This caused ColdSync to fail under
	Linux.

	the Palm.

	* src/install.c: Added error-checking.

	* src/conduit.c, src/coldsync.c, src/backup.c: Check to see

	definition.

	* config.h.in: Removed HAVE_IPV6. It's useless.

	* README: Added note for DU with DEC's C compiler.

	* conduits/todo-text, conduits/send-mail: Added missing colons in
	example .coldsyncrc entry.

2001-03-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* perl/ColdSync/ColdSync.pm (bug fix): "<conduit> -config" would

	about indentation.

2001-02-23  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	call to snprintf(), now that it's known to be available.

	* perl/ColdSync/ColdSync/SPC.pm: Fixed indentation etc. to match
	the rest of the file. Clarified documentation for
	&dlp_SetSysDateTime. Commented out trace statements.

	* perl/ColdSync/ColdSync/SPC.pm: Added &dlp_GetSysDateTime,
	&dlp_SetSysDateTime. Patch supplied by JD Smith
	<jdsmith@astro.cornell.edu>.

2001-02-22  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/install.c, src/coldsync.c: Use snprintf() instead of ugly
	chains of strncat().

2001-02-21  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* i18n/fr.po: Latest version of strings. Fixed some translations.

	* i18n/de.po: Latest version of strings. Unfuzzied one
	translation.

2001-02-20  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- Version 2.0.0 released.

	* src/parser.y: If serial number begins with '*', don't calculate
	a checksum, since it's probably special.

	* src/palm.c: Added special_snums[]. fetch_serial() knows about
	special serial numbers.

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added description of special serial number for
	Visors.

	* src/coldsync.c: Added run_mode_Daemon(). Various modifications
	to main() to work properly in daemon mode. Got rid of remnants of
	Getty mode. Added some Verbose() statements. Some cosmetic
	changes; added some "to do" comments.

	* src/config.c: Added "-v" option. load_config() now takes 'Bool
	read_user_config' to determine whether to read ~/.coldsyncrc .
	This sorta simplifies things for daemon mode. In set_mode(),
	uncommented daemon mode stuff; got rid of getty mode.

	* src/coldsync.h: Got rid of "mode_Getty". Redocumented
	mode_Daemon. Fixed declaration of load_config().

	* src/Makefile: Added palment.c, palment.h.

	* libpconn/PConnection_serial.c: pconn_serial_open() uses stdin if
	'device' is NULL. Cosmetic cleaning.

	* libpconn/PConnection.c: pconn_serial_open() now takes a Bool.

2001-02-18  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* conduits/memo-text: Update for newer Palm::StdAppInfo. Patch
	submitted by <forsberg+coldsync@lysator.liu.se> (Erik Forsberg)

2001-02-16  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/palment.h, src/palment.c (added): Functions for reading
	/etc/palms.

2001-02-08  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added mention of "-v" option.

	* src/coldsync.h: Added 'verbosity' global option. Added
	declaration for Verbose().

	* src/misc.c: Added Verbose().

2001-01-30  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added description of "-s" and "-l" options.

	* src/coldsync.c (bug fix): When suggesting a pda{} block, print
	it to stderr. Ugly, but it will avoid problems in getty mode.

	* src/config.c (bug fix): Don't complain if no config file
	specified on the command line, and ~/.coldsyncrc doesn't exist.

	- Version 1.6.7 released.

	* src/net_compat.h: Added definition of INET_ADDRSTRLEN and
	INET6_ADDRSTRLEN, for those OSes that don't have them.

	* src/net_compat.c: Added <string.h>.
	(portability): added declaration for snprintf().

	* src/lexer.l: Removed Solaris and Linux hacks, thanks to
	"lexhack.c" (which is uglier).

	* src/config.c: Reinstated <sys/ioctl.h>. #include <stropts.h>
	under DU. Declared some structures because DU's headers are badly
	fscked. Removed test for EGCS.

	* src/coldsync.h: Added vsnprintf() declaration.

	* src/coldsync.c: Cast bzero()'s argument, for portability.

	* src/Makefile: Added "lexhack.c"

	* src/lexhack.c (added): Icky hack to make lexer compile cleanly.

	* libpconn/PConnection_net.c (portability): now compiles under
	Solaris.

	* i18n/Makefile: Now builds lex.yy.c if necessary.

	* configure.in: Better test for gethostbyname() under Linux. Added
	tests for a number of headers and functions. Tests for inet_pton()
	and friends now use AC_SEARCH_LIBS, since they appear in different
	libraries on different OSes.

	* config.h.in: Added standard #defines for various functions and
	headers. Preprocessor symbols _POSIX_C_SOURCE, __EXTENSIONS_,
	_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED have been deemed to be Good Things, and are
	defined in all cases.

	* README: Updated portability notes.

2001-01-28  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* src/coldsync.c (feature): "-l logfile" now sends all debugging
	output to the log file. Replaced perror() with Perror().

	* src/coldsync.h: Added global_opts.log_fname. Added declaration
	of Perror().

	* src/misc.c: Added some comments. Warn(), Error() and Perror()
	now log both to the log file and to syslog, as necessary.

	* src/config.c: Added "-l logfile" option. Replaced perror() with
	Perror().

	* src/restore.c, src/parser.y, src/log.c, src/install.c,
	src/conduit.c, src/backup.c, src/archive.c: Replaced perror() with
	Perror().

2001-01-25  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* doc/coldsync.8: Added Visor+Rio bug.

	* src/config.c: Futzed around trying to make #includes portable.
	Added "-s" option for syslog. Trimmed trailing newline from error
	messages.

	* src/coldsync.c: Added some #includes for portability. Added
	openlog()/closelog() for syslog. Trimmed trailing newlines from
	error messages.

	* src/coldsync.h: Added global_opts.use_syslog.

	* src/restore.c, src/pref.c, src/parser.y, src/palm.c, src/log.c,
	src/lexer.l, src/install.c, src/conduit.c, src/backup.c,
	src/archive.c, src/GenericConduit.cc: Trimmed trailing newline
	from error messages.

	* src/misc.c: Warn() and Error() now use syslog if "-s" option
	given. They also append \n automatically when printing to stderr.

	* Makefile: Added rotated files to distribution.

	* OLDNEWS.1 (added): Rotated NEWS. Numbers go with ChangeLog.

	* ChangeLog.1 (added): Rotated ChangeLog.

2001-01-22  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	- ColdSync is now two years old. And still fits on a floppy!
