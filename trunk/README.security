	ColdSync Security Considerations


No Security
== ========

	ColdSync uses Palm's HotSync communications protocols, which
are inherently insecure. There is no equivalent of ssh or Kerberos.
There is no encryption or authentication between the Palm and the
desktop host.
	It is trivial to spoof a connection using a laptop with a Palm
emulator such as POSE or xcopilot, or with a custom program.

	In this respect, an incoming sync connection is similar to an
incoming SMTP connection, so ColdSync aims to be about as secure (in
principle) as procmail.


Setuid-ness
===========

	ColdSync is not setuid. It does not need to be.

	In standalone mode, ColdSync runs with the privileges of the
user running it, so it can only do as much damage as that user.

	In daemon mode, ColdSync normally starts out running as root.
When it receives an incoming connection, it reads the serial number,
username, and userid from the Palm, looks them up in
/usr/local/etc/palms, and setuid()s to the appropriate user. If no
match is found in /usr/local/etc/palms, ColdSync aborts the sync.


Conduits
========

	Conduits are programs that ColdSync runs on Palm databases. In
this respect, they are similar to procmail recipes that run on certain
messages.
	As the system administrator, you have a certain amount of
control over which conduits may be run by users.
	The file /usr/local/etc/coldsync.conf is read before the
user's ~/.coldsyncrc ; logically, ColdSync behaves as if it had one
configuration file:

	conduit sync {
		type: */*;
		path: [generic];
		default;
	}

	#include /usr/local/etc/coldsync.conf
	#include ~/.coldsyncrc

Thus, if /usr/local/etc/coldsync.conf contains the entry

	conduit sync {
		type: todo/DATA;
		final;
	}

then no sync conduits will run on any todo/DATA ("ToDoDB") databases.
The entry

	conduit fetch, dump, sync, install {
		type: */*;
		final;
	}

prevents any conduits after this entry from running.

	Likewise, you can require certain conduits to be run by adding
them to /usr/local/etc/coldsync.conf .
