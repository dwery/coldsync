# See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
# the contents of the Makefile that is written.

# NOTE:
# The default prefix may be wrong. Under FreeBSD, for instance, Perl
# is part of the base system, so the prefix is "/usr". This is wrong,
# since this Makefile.PL distinguishes between run-time prefix and
# install-time prefix:
#	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/foo	<- run-time prefix
#	make
#	make install PREFIX=/bar	<- install-time prefix
# The above will install this package in /bar (/bar/bin/coldsync,
# etc.), but when it runs, it will think it's in /foo. This is
# important for various package-management utilities (e.g., 'stow',
# the Debian package manager, etc.)

# NOTE:
# The paths in the .packlist generated by "make install" will be based
# on the install-time prefix (see above). Whether this is correct or
# not depends on why, exactly, you're specifying different build-time
# and install-time prefixes.

#	make
#	make install PREFIX=/bar
# won't work: it'll still try to install scripts in /foo/bin.
#	This function corrects this: it runs after the install
