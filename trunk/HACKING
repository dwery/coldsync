   * * Guidelines for contributors, most important ones first: * *

- Try to leave this code as clean as you wish you had found it.

- If you're in a rush to get something done, but something isn't quite
  right, put an XXX comment (with explanation) next to it. Otherwise,
  odds are you won't be able to easily find it and fix it next week;
  certainly no one else will.

- As much as possible, if you add something, try to make it optional.
  E.g., KDE and Gnome support would be cool, but not everyone is
  running KDE or Gnome, so don't assume that they are available.

- Always compile with "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" (or the local equivalent
  of a language lawyer looking over your shoulder). If you stick to
  the rules, you're less likely to introduce some non-portability or a
  memory leak.
