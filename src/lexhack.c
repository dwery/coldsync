/* This is a gross hack. The file created by 'flex' contains
 *	#include "config.h"
 * but not as the first thing in the file.
 * Since "config.h" includes some #defines and such to make things
 * work smoothly under various OSes, "lex.yy.c" doesn't always have
 * these symbols defined at the right time, so the compiler complains.
 * This hack forces "config.h" to be included first.
