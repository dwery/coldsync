/* XXX - There are two aspects to conduit configuration: `struct
 * conduit_desc' is supplied by the conduit (i.e., by the person writing
 * the conduit) describes what a conduit _can_ do; `struct conduit_config'
 * is supplied by the ColdSync config file(s) and specifies what a conduit
 * _should_ do.
 *
 * At initialization, find out what conduits are available. Put all of
 * these conduits (their `conduit_desc', that is) into a pool. Then read
 * the config files and create "should" lists out of them. These lists
 * specify which conduits ought to do what, and in what order to search for
 * them.
 *
 * It's probably best to have one "should" list per function: that is, have
 * one list for pre-fetch conduits, one for syncing, one for installs, and
 * so forth. This should allow maximal flexibility: say you have two
 * conduits, "Freshmeat" and "NewsDump" that both provide `sync' and
 * `post-dump' functions for the same set of databases. The scheme outlined
 * above allows you to use "Freshmeat"'s `sync' function and "NewsDump"'s
 * `post-dump' function on the same database.
 *
 * `struct conduit_desc' contains the name of the conduit (possibly its
 * version),
