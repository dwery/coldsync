Andrew Arensburger <arensb@ooblick.com>: Project coordinator and
	benevolent dictator.
Mark Coletti <mcoletti@clark.net>: The original Makefile.am, which was
	then mangled out of all recognition and finally tossed.
Rob Fugina <robf@geeks.com>: Alpha-testing at personal risk to his
	data.
Justin Ferguson <jferg@lusars.net>: groveled through .h files to come
	up with a patch for misbehaving 'gcc's.

	A big thank you to Kenneth Albanowski and the rest of the
authors of the pilot-link code, for providing a reference
implementation.
